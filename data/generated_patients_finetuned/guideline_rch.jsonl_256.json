  "IVIG on blood transfusion_1": "    Case 1:\n    A 45-year-old female patient with a history of recurrent infections presented with generalized weakness and fatigue, along with a tingling sensation in her extremities. The tingling was rated at 4/10 in intensity and had been persistent for the last two weeks. The patient's medical history revealed a reliance on frequent blood transfusions due to an underlying hematological condition. Despite prior transfusions, her symptoms have not shown significant improvement. Physical examination did not reveal any focal neurological deficits. Given the patient's ongoing weakness, fatigue, and peripheral neuropathy, further evaluation is warranted to determine the underlying cause and explore the potential benefit of IVIG therapy in the context of her blood transfusion history.",
  "IVIG on blood transfusion_2": "    Case 2:\n    A 50-year-old male patient, known to have an autoimmune disorder, presented with a constellation of symptoms. He reported recurrent episodes of muscle pain and tenderness, with an average pain intensity of 6/10, which have persisted for the past month. In addition, the patient described a sensation of numbness and tingling in his lower extremities, rated at 3/10 in severity. Despite conventional treatments for his autoimmune condition, including blood transfusions, the patient's musculoskeletal symptoms have not shown significant improvement. Physical examination revealed tender points in multiple muscle groups. Given the chronic nature of the patient's muscle pain, along with the associated peripheral neuropathy, an assessment involving IVIG therapy following blood transfusion is warranted to address his complex symptomatology.",
  "IVIG on blood transfusion_3": "    Case 3:\n    A 60-year-old male patient, with a history of chronic inflammatory disorders, presented with a 3-month history of recurrent headaches. The headaches were described as throbbing in nature, localized to the bilateral temporal regions, and were rated at 7/10 in intensity. The patient reported a pattern of exacerbation following each blood transfusion, which he underwent as part of his ongoing medical management. Notably, the headaches were not responsive to over-the-counter analgesics. The patient's neurological examination was unremarkable. Given the temporal relationship between the blood transfusions and the onset of severe headaches, there is a need to investigate the potential role of IVIG therapy in the context of his transfusion-related symptoms and underlying inflammatory conditions."
