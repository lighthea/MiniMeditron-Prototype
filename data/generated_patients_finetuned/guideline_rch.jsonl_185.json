  "Eye injuries in children_1": "\n  **Patient Description 1:**\n  An 8-year-old male child was brought in by his parents, presenting with severe eye pain, photophobia, and a noticeable decrease in visual acuity in his left eye. The child has a history of potential penetrating eye trauma from a recent outdoor play activity. On examination, the left eye appears red, and there are signs of swelling in the eyelids. The child is notably distressed, making it challenging to conduct a comprehensive assessment of eye movements. The presence of a cloudy cornea and vertically-linear corneal abrasions is observed. Given the age of the patient and the distress level, obtaining a detailed ophthalmic evaluation poses difficulty at this time.",
