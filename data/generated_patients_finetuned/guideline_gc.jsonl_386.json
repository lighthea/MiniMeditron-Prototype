  "Acute Liver Failure_1": "    Patient A, a 42-year-old male with a history of occasional acetaminophen (APAP) use for chronic back pain, presents with concerning symptoms. He is experiencing grade 2 encephalopathy, characterized by intermittent disorientation and mild confusion. Laboratory tests reveal coagulopathy, with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5. The patient's blood pressure is persistently low, indicating hypotension. Notably, there is a strong suspicion of APAP toxicity as a potential cause. The diagnostic process is further complicated by the presence of hyperammonemia. Given the patient's clinical presentation and history, urgent evaluation and management are warranted.",
  "Acute Liver Failure_2": "    Patient B, a 30-year-old woman, is admitted with acute liver failure. She has a history of non-APAP medication use for a chronic autoimmune condition. The patient exhibits grade 3 encephalopathy, characterized by pronounced confusion and behavioral changes. Laboratory tests reveal severe coagulopathy, with an INR of 3.0, and significantly elevated ammonia levels. Despite fluid resuscitation, the patient's blood pressure remains low (hypotension). The non-APAP etiology of her condition adds complexity to the diagnostic process. Immediate assessment and intervention are essential in this critical clinical scenario.",
  "Acute Liver Failure_3": "    Patient C, a 50-year-old male, presents with acute liver failure and a complex clinical picture. He has a history of resolved hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, but there is concern regarding potential reactivation of HBV as a contributing factor. The patient exhibits grade 2 encephalopathy, with intermittent confusion and mild disorientation. Coagulopathy is evident on laboratory testing, with an INR of 2.6. Additionally, he displays signs of hypotension. The presence of reactivation of HBV further complicates the diagnostic process. Timely and comprehensive evaluation is crucial in elucidating the underlying cause of his acute liver failure."
