  "Mediastinal masses_1": "    Patient A, a 45-year-old non-smoker, presents with unexplained symptoms, including a persistent cough rated at 4/10 in severity, along with occasional hoarseness and mild difficulty swallowing. Physical examination reveals the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The patient has no prior history of respiratory conditions or malignancies. Imaging studies, including CT and PET scans, are readily available for diagnostic evaluation. The timely assessment of this mediastinal mass is warranted, given the patient's symptoms and the availability of necessary imaging modalities.",
  "Mediastinal masses_2": "    Patient B, a 55-year-old individual, reports a chronic cough rated at 6/10 in intensity and intermittent episodes of shortness of breath. These symptoms have been ongoing for several months and are unresponsive to over-the-counter cough remedies. The patient's medical history is significant for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is well-controlled with medication. Physical examination discloses the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Diagnostic evaluation is feasible, with access to imaging studies such as CT and PET scans. The quality of pathological specimens can be ensured. The evaluation of the mediastinal mass is particularly crucial in the context of the patient's persistent, unexplained symptoms and the need to discern any potential link to the underlying etiology.",
  "Mediastinal masses_3": "    Patient C, a 50-year-old individual, presents with a history of recurrent episodes of cough, occasionally accompanied by hoarseness. The cough is rated at 5/10 in severity and has not shown significant improvement with prior over-the-counter cough suppressants. The patient is otherwise healthy and has no prior respiratory conditions. Physical examination reveals mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Access to imaging studies, including CT and PET scans, is readily available for diagnostic purposes. The patient's lifestyle is notable for occupational exposure to environmental pollutants. Given the presence of unexplained symptoms and the contextual factors, such as the occupational history, a timely assessment of the mediastinal mass is essential to elucidate the underlying pathology."
