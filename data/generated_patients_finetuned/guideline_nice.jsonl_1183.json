The availability of NICE guidance and evidence submission by the manufacturer will be essential in guiding the diagnostic and treatment approach for this patient.",
  "opioid-induced bowel dysfunction in people with advanced illness receiving palliative care_3": "    A 55-year-old female, undergoing palliative care for a metastatic malignancy, reported notable constipation that has been ongoing for several weeks.

  "opioid-induced bowel dysfunction in people with advanced illness receiving palliative care_4": "    Patient Description 3:\n    \n    In a palliative care setting, a 72-year-old male with end-stage cancer presented with chronic constipation. The patient described his discomfort as severe, with a persistent pain level of 8/10 and significant straining during bowel movements. Lifestyle modifications and over-the-counter laxatives have not provided relief. The patient's history of opioid use for pain management, in conjunction with the context of advanced illness, raises strong suspicion of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction. The availability of NICE guidance and evidence submission by the manufacturer will play a crucial role in formulating an appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic strategy for this patient."
