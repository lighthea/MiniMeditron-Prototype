  "Distress and needle phobia from repeated attempts at intravenous access_3": "Description 3:\nIn our clinic, a 12-year-old patient with a history of congenital heart disease and single ventricle physiology presented with pronounced distress and anxiety during the initiation of intravenous access. The patient reported a pain level of 8 out of 10 during the procedure, which significantly contributed to their overall distress.
