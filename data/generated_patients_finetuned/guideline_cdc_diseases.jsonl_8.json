  "Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic fever_1": " 1.  A 43-year-old male patient with a history of working in a livestock farm presented with sudden-onset high-grade fever (101.8\u00b0F), severe headache (8/10 on the pain scale), and myalgia affecting his calves and lower back. The fever persisted for over a week and was accompanied by profuse sweating. The patient reported a recent tick bite, and his occupation exposes him to potential tick habitats. He has no significant medical history, and there are no known factors affecting the diagnostic evaluation. The initial supportive treatment with antipyretics did not provide sustained relief. Given the patient's occupational exposure, travel history, and the constellation of symptoms, a thorough evaluation for tick-borne diseases, including Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, is warranted.",
  "Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic fever_2": "2.  A 35-year-old female, who resides in a rural area, presented with a 4-day history of fever, body aches, and photophobia. The fever has been fluctuating between 100.4\u00b0F and 102.2\u00b0F and was associated with chills. The patient described her headache as pounding (7/10 on the pain scale) and located behind her eyes. She also reported generalized myalgia and anorexia. There is no significant medical history or travel to endemic regions. However, the patient mentioned frequent exposure to ticks due to her outdoor activities. These symptoms, along with the tick exposure, raise concerns about potential tick-borne illnesses such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and prompt diagnostic evaluation is necessary.",
  "Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic fever_3": "3.  A 50-year-old male patient, who works as a veterinarian, presented with a 5-day history of fever and malaise. The fever has been persistent, reaching 103.1\u00b0F, and was associated with severe retro-orbital headache (9/10 on the pain scale), photophobia, and pronounced fatigue. The patient reported frequent tick exposure in the course of his work. There is no significant past medical history or recent travel. The initial empiric treatment with antipyretics did not yield substantial improvement. Given the occupational risk factors and the constellation of symptoms, including the intense retro-orbital headache, a thorough evaluation for tick-borne diseases, particularly Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, is crucial in this case."
