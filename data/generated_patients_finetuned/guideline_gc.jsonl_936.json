  "Choledocholithiasis_1": " 1.   Patient Description: A 60-year-old male presented with recurring episodes of upper abdominal pain radiating to his back, which he described as severe (7/10 on the pain scale). The pain episodes have been accompanied by fever, chills, and jaundice. He has a history of symptomatic cholelithiasis without high-risk criteria and had undergone cholecystectomy ten years ago. On examination, his liver function tests were abnormal, and ultrasound revealed a dilated common bile duct. Given the patient's age, abnormal liver tests, and the presence of biliary obstruction-related symptoms, choledocholithiasis is a primary diagnostic consideration.",
  "Choledocholithiasis_2": "2.   Patient Description: A 65-year-old female, with a known history of cholelithiasis, presented with episodic upper abdominal pain (6/10 in intensity) that often radiates to her back. She experienced two episodes of jaundice in the last six months, which were self-limiting. On this occasion, the pain was accompanied by fever and a sensation of chills. Her liver function tests were found to be abnormal. Ultrasound revealed a dilated common bile duct. The patient's age, recurrent biliary symptoms, and the presence of abnormal liver tests indicate a high index of suspicion for choledocholithiasis.",
  "Choledocholithiasis_3": "3. Patient Description: A 58-year-old male patient, who had previously undergone a cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis, presented with severe (8/10) and persistent upper abdominal pain, which was radiating to his back. He also reported episodes of jaundice and recurrent bouts of fever. The patient's liver function tests were abnormal, and ultrasound showed a dilated common bile duct. Given his medical history, abnormal liver tests, and the recurrence of biliary symptoms, the likely diagnosis is choledocholithiasis. Further evaluation is crucial to guide appropriate management."
