  "Recurrent glioblastoma multiforme_1": "1. Mr. J, a 54-year-old right-handed gentleman, presents with a history of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, which was initially treated with surgical resection and subsequent carmustine implants. He describes a persistent, throbbing headache localized in the frontal region, with an intensity rating of 6/10 on the visual analog scale. The headache is progressively worsening and is not effectively alleviated by over-the-counter analgesics. Additionally, he experiences episodes of dizziness and has noted a gradual decline in his cognitive function, as reported by his family. Given his prior history and the characteristic nature of his headache, further evaluation is imperative to assess the extent of recurrent disease and determine the appropriate management strategy.",
  "Recurrent glioblastoma multiforme_2": "2. Mrs. S, a 49-year-old woman, is known to have recurrent glioblastoma multiforme and had previously undergone surgical resection followed by carmustine implant therapy. She presents with a complex clinical picture, characterized by a constellation of symptoms. The prominent feature is a persistent, severe headache, rated 8/10 in intensity, which radiates from the parietal to the temporal region. The headache is accompanied by frequent episodes of nausea and vomiting, further impacting her quality of life. Despite her adherence to prescribed analgesics, the pain remains refractory. Additionally, she has developed new-onset weakness in her left upper and lower extremities, along with difficulties in coordination. These neurological deficits have contributed to a marked impairment in her daily activities. Given the history of glioblastoma multiforme and the evolving symptomatology, a comprehensive assessment is essential to delineate the extent of disease recurrence and its impact on the central nervous system.",
  "Recurrent glioblastoma multiforme_3": "3. Mr. B, a 57-year-old gentleman, has a documented history of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, for which he underwent surgical resection and received carmustine implants as part of his initial treatment. He now presents with a persistent, dull headache localized in the occipital region, with an intensity rating of 5/10. The headache is often accompanied by visual disturbances, including blurry vision and occasional flashes of light. Despite regular use of analgesic medication, he reports a gradual worsening of his visual symptoms and a sense of pressure behind his eyes. Moreover, he describes episodes of confusion and memory difficulties, which have become concerning to both himself and his family. Given the context of his medical history and the emergence of new visual and cognitive manifestations, a thorough evaluation is essential to assess the status of recurrent disease and its potential impact on the visual pathways and cognitive function."
