  "Gallbladder cancer_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 62-year-old male patient presented with persistent, dull abdominal pain rated at 4/10 in the upper right quadrant, which has been ongoing for the past three months. He reported a progressive feeling of abdominal bloating and unexplained weight loss of 10 pounds over the same period. Physical examination revealed yellowing of the skin and sclera. The patient's medical history is notable for a long-standing presence of gallstones. These findings, in conjunction with the observed symptoms, raise concerns regarding a hepatobiliary pathology and necessitate further diagnostic evaluation.",
  "Gallbladder cancer_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 55-year-old female patient with a history of gallbladder disease presented with a two-month history of recurrent, sharp abdominal pain localized to the upper right quadrant, with an intensity rating of 6/10. The pain episodes are often associated with abdominal bloating. The patient reported unintended weight loss of 8 pounds despite maintaining her usual diet and activity level. Physical examination revealed mild jaundice. Given the patient's sex, age, and history of gallbladder disease, the presence of these symptoms raises a high index of suspicion for a significant hepatobiliary condition, warranting a thorough diagnostic workup.",
  "Gallbladder cancer_3": "    Patient Description 3:\n    An 68-year-old male patient presented with a four-month history of persistent, gnawing abdominal pain rated at 5/10, predominantly localized to the upper right abdomen. The pain is frequently accompanied by abdominal bloating. The patient reported an unintended weight loss of 12 pounds. On examination, noticeable jaundice of the skin and sclera was observed. The patient has a history of chronic inflammation of the bile ducts. The constellation of symptoms, along with the patient's medical history, underscores the need for a comprehensive diagnostic assessment to elucidate the underlying hepatobiliary pathology.\n"
