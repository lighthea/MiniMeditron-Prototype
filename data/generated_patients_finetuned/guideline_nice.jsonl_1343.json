  "Obstructed defaecation syndrome_1": "Description 1:\nA 43-year-old female patient, with a history of two vaginal deliveries, presented with a distressing symptomatology indicative of obstructed defaecation syndrome. She reported frequent unsuccessful attempts at faecal evacuation, often accompanied by excessive straining rated at 7/10 on the pain scale. Additionally, she experienced a persistent sense of incomplete faecal evacuation, which significantly impacted her quality of life. The patient also reported intermittent episodes of rectal pain (5/10) and bleeding after defaecation. These symptoms have been ongoing for the past six months. Given the patient's gender and obstetric history, the presence of structural defects such as rectocele or internal rectal prolapse should be carefully considered during the diagnostic workup.",
  "Obstructed defaecation syndrome_2": "Description 2:\nA 55-year-old male patient presented with a concerning set of symptoms consistent with obstructed defaecation syndrome. He reported recurrent unsuccessful faecal evacuation attempts, often characterized by a high degree of straining (8/10 in intensity). The patient described a distressing sensation of incomplete faecal evacuation after bowel movements, which has been a persistent issue for the past year. Furthermore, he reported episodes of rectal pain, which he rated at 6/10 in severity. Physical examination and medical history did not reveal any significant contributory factors. Thus, the diagnostic investigation should focus on identifying potential structural defects in the rectum, considering the presence of internal rectal prolapse or other anatomical abnormalities.",
  "Obstructed defaecation syndrome_3": "Description 3:\nA 36-year-old male patient, without any significant medical history, presented with troubling symptoms suggestive of obstructed defaecation syndrome. He described frequent unsuccessful attempts at faecal evacuation, accompanied by a notable degree of straining (rated at 7/10 for pain). The patient reported a persistent sense of incomplete faecal evacuation and noted occasional episodes of rectal bleeding after defaecation. These symptoms have been ongoing for the past eight months and have led to a decreased quality of life for the patient. Given the absence of prior medical conditions, the diagnostic evaluation should prioritize investigating potential structural defects in the rectum, aiming to identify the underlying cause of the patient's obstructed defaecation syndrome."
