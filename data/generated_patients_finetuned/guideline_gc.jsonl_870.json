  "Portal Hypertensive Bleeding in Cirrhosis_1": "    Patient A, a 58-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and known cirrhosis, presented with a sudden onset of melena and hematemesis. The hematemesis was rated 7/10 in intensity and was accompanied by lightheadedness. Diagnostic factors affecting the case include the presence of cirrhosis, alcohol use, and the high-risk nature of varices. Notably, the patient had previously been diagnosed with gastroesophageal varices during routine endoscopic evaluations. The severity of bleeding, in conjunction with the underlying liver disease, necessitates an urgent assessment and intervention.",
  "Portal Hypertensive Bleeding in Cirrhosis_2": "    Patient B, a 52-year-old female, was admitted with symptoms of black, tarry stools and hematemesis, which she described as severe, with a pain level of 8/10. She has a medical history significant for hepatitis C-induced cirrhosis. Diagnostic factors contributing to the case include a history of cirrhosis, prior identification of esophageal varices, and ongoing liver stiffness. The patient's presentation is further complicated by a platelet count below normal. These elements underscore the heightened risk and complexity associated with her portal hypertensive bleeding, demanding a prompt and comprehensive diagnostic approach.",
  "Portal Hypertensive Bleeding in Cirrhosis_3": "    Patient C, a 60-year-old male with a long-standing history of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-related cirrhosis, presented with episodes of hematemesis and melena. He described the hematemesis as moderately intense, with a pain level of 5/10. Diagnostic factors in this case include obesity, liver injury due to NASH, and the presence of known gastric varices (GOV1) documented in prior endoscopic examinations. The patient's condition is further complicated by a history of refractory ascites. Given the recurrent nature of bleeding and the underlying liver disease, a comprehensive assessment is imperative to guide appropriate management and treatment decisions."
