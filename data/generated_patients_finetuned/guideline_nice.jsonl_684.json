  "Chronic low back pain_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 55-year-old male patient with a history of prolonged occupational heavy lifting presented with severe chronic low back pain, which he described as a constant, stabbing sensation rated 8/10 in intensity. The pain has become lifestyle-limiting, affecting his ability to engage in work and recreational activities. Despite previous attempts with physical therapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the pain persists. Given the patient's occupation and the nature of his symptoms, degenerative changes in the intervertebral discs or spinal facet joints are important considerations in the diagnostic workup.",
  "Chronic low back pain_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 45-year-old female patient, who works in a sedentary office job, reported a debilitating chronic low back pain that she described as a constant, dull ache with intermittent sharp exacerbations, rated at 7/10 in intensity. The pain has significantly limited her ability to sit for prolonged periods and has started to impact her work productivity. Lumbar imaging revealed degenerative changes in the intervertebral discs and spinal facet joints. Despite undergoing epidural steroid injections, the patient continues to experience lifestyle-limiting chronic low back pain, prompting further evaluation and management.",
  "Chronic low back pain_3": "    Patient Description 3:\n    A 60-year-old male patient presented with severe, lifestyle-limiting chronic low back pain, characterized by a persistent, throbbing sensation, which he rated at 9/10 in intensity. The pain has substantially impacted his quality of life, making routine activities challenging. The patient's medical history is notable for long-term heavy lifting during his career. Despite conservative measures and a brief trial of opioid analgesics, the pain remains uncontrolled. Given the occupational history and the nature of the symptoms, degenerative changes in the intervertebral discs or spinal facet joints are prominent in the differential diagnosis and necessitate comprehensive assessment and treatment."
