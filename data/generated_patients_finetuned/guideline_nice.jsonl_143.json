  "Chronic limb threatening ischaemia (CLTI)_1": "Patient A, a 65-year-old male with a notable medical history of uncontrolled hypertension and heavy smoking, presented with a complex array of symptoms indicative of an advanced vascular condition. He reported a persistent ischaemic pain in his lower left limb, which he described as excruciating, with a severity level of 8 on a scale of 0 to 10. Physical examination revealed severely diminished circulation in the affected limb, coupled with ulceration and tissue loss. The association with high amputation and mortality rates, along with the markedly poor quality of life, underscores the urgency and gravity of this clinical presentation, necessitating prompt and comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and management.",
  "Chronic limb threatening ischaemia (CLTI)_2": "Patient B, a 70-year-old female, with a long-standing history of diabetes, peripheral arterial disease, and smoking, presented with a concerning vascular pathology. She described a constant ischaemic pain in her right lower limb, rated at 7 in intensity, persisting despite conservative measures. Physical examination uncovered severely diminished circulation, alongside an area of ulceration and tissue loss. Given the underlying risk factors and the established association of this condition with high amputation and mortality rates, as well as the substantial impact on quality of life, a timely and comprehensive diagnostic assessment is imperative to guide appropriate therapeutic interventions.",
  "Chronic limb threatening ischaemia (CLTI)_3": "Patient C, a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and smoking, sought medical evaluation for a persistent and severe ischaemic pain in his lower right limb, which he rated as 9 in intensity. Physical examination revealed markedly diminished circulation, along with ulceration and gangrenous tissue loss. The gravity of this presentation, combined with the patient's risk factors and the known association with high amputation and mortality rates, as well as the resultant poor quality of life, underscores the critical need for an urgent and comprehensive diagnostic workup to guide the optimal management of this chronic limb-threatening ischaemia."
