  "Heart valve disease_1": "    Case 1:\n    A 65-year-old male patient presented with a persistent whooshing sound, documented as a heart murmur, during auscultation. He reported recurrent episodes of chest pain, which he described as sharp and intermittent, with an average intensity of 5/10. Additionally, the patient experienced abdominal swelling, attributed to advanced tricuspid regurgitation. He reported a notable increase in fatigue, especially during physical activities. Shortness of breath was another significant concern, particularly when lying down. The patient indicated a history of hypertension and high cholesterol. Given these symptoms and the patient's age and medical history, a comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation is warranted to assess the underlying etiology of his condition.",
  "Heart valve disease_2": "    Case 2:\n    A 45-year-old female patient presented with a heart murmur, characterized by a persistent whooshing sound during cardiac auscultation. She reported frequent episodes of chest pain, with an average intensity of 4/10, which had been ongoing for several months. The patient also described occasional dizziness and a feeling of lightheadedness. She had a history of congenital heart disease. The presence of these symptoms, along with the patient's medical background, necessitates a thorough assessment to determine the nature and severity of her cardiac condition.",
  "Heart valve disease_3": "    Case 3:\n    A 50-year-old male patient reported a persistent heart murmur, documented during a routine medical examination. He described episodes of chest pain, with an average intensity of 6/10, often accompanied by palpitations and an irregular heartbeat. The patient also experienced frequent episodes of shortness of breath, particularly during physical exertion. He had a history of heart disease and a prior heart attack. Given the combination of symptoms and the patient's medical history, an in-depth cardiac evaluation is essential to elucidate the underlying pathology and guide appropriate management."
