  "Lumbar Disc Herniation With Radiculopathy_2": "    A 45-year-old, overweight male patient presented with chronic lower back pain, rated 6/10 on the pain scale, which radiates down his left leg to the dorsum of the foot (dermatome distribution of L5). The pain is often accompanied by a sensation of weakness and occasional numbness in the same dermatomal pattern. The symptoms have been persisting for six months and are aggravated during prolonged sitting or physical exertion. The patient has a history of recurrent lower back pain episodes, for which he has undergone various conservative treatments, including physiotherapy and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Clinical evaluation reveals a positive straight leg raise test on the left side. The presence of these symptoms, along with the patient's age, duration of symptoms, and previous history, warrants a comprehensive diagnostic workup to determine the degree of nerve root compression and the most appropriate management strategy.",
  "Lumbar Disc Herniation With Radiculopathy_4": "    A 32-year-old female patient, who works as a professional driver, presented with a chief complaint of sharp, shooting pain in her right buttock and posterior thigh, which she rates at 8/10 in intensity. The pain follows a myotomal distribution pattern corresponding to the S1 nerve root. The patient reports occasional episodes of muscle weakness in her right leg, particularly during prolonged periods of sitting or driving. The symptoms have been ongoing for three months and are exacerbated by bending or lifting activities. Despite trying over-the-counter pain medications and modifying her sitting posture, the symptoms have persisted. The patient has no significant past medical history. Given the nature of her occupation, the duration and character of the symptoms, and the documented impact on her daily activities, a prompt and in-depth diagnostic assessment is crucial to evaluate the degree of nerve root compression and determine an appropriate course of action.",
  "Lumbar Disc Herniation With Radiculopathy_6": "    A 50-year-old male patient, with a history of chronic lower back pain, presented with a new set of symptoms. He describes a dull, aching sensation in his lower back, rated at 5/10 in severity, which extends down his right leg to the lateral aspect of the calf (L4 dermatomal distribution). The pain is often accompanied by a tingling and numbness in the same region. The patient reports that the symptoms have been recurring for the past four months and are worsened during prolonged standing or walking. He has tried using heat packs and gentle stretching exercises to alleviate the discomfort, with only temporary relief. Physical examination reveals mild muscle weakness in the right leg. The patient's medical history is notable for occasional episodes of lower back pain, which were managed conservatively. The presence of these new symptoms, along with the patient's age, the duration of symptoms, and the observed nerve root involvement, necessitates a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to assess the degree of nerve root compression and guide the most suitable treatment plan."
