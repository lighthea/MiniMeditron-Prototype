  "Lung Cancer_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 62-year-old male, a former heavy smoker with a 30 pack-year history, presented with a persistent cough that has been ongoing for the past six months. The cough is non-productive and has recently been accompanied by episodes of coughing up blood, which has significantly raised the patient's concern. He also reports experiencing chest pain (rated 5/10 in intensity) that is exacerbated by deep breathing and coughing. Despite his weight loss of 10 pounds over the last three months, the patient has noted a loss of appetite and increased fatigue, which have been interfering with his daily activities. The clinical features, in conjunction with the patient's smoking history, raise a strong suspicion of an underlying pulmonary pathology, necessitating a comprehensive diagnostic workup.",
  "Lung Cancer_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 58-year-old female, nonsmoker, presented with a three-month history of hoarseness and an intermittent, persistent cough. The cough is non-productive and is often associated with a sensation of chest tightness. The patient has also experienced a gradual onset of shortness of breath, particularly with exertion, which has led to a notable decline in her exercise tolerance. Additionally, she reported a weight loss of 15 pounds over the past four months, accompanied by a loss of appetite. The hoarseness has been a source of considerable distress for the patient, affecting her professional interactions as a public speaker. Given the clinical presentation and the persistence of symptoms, further evaluation is crucial to determine the underlying etiology and formulate an appropriate management plan.",
  "Lung Cancer_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 64-year-old male, with a history of occupational exposure to asbestos, presented with a persistent cough that has progressed over the last eight months. The cough is productive, yielding purulent sputum, and is often tinged with blood. The patient described his chest pain as a constant dull ache (rated 4/10) localized to the right hemithorax, which has been present for the past two months. He also experiences recurrent episodes of shortness of breath and has noticed a significant decline in his overall weight, with an unintentional loss of 12 pounds in the last three months. Fatigue and a persistent feeling of malaise have further impacted his ability to perform his job as a construction worker. Given the occupational history and the nature of the symptoms, a thorough investigation is necessary to elucidate the underlying pathology and guide appropriate interventions."
