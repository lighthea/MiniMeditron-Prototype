  "Galactorrhea_1": "  Patient Description 1:\n  A 32-year-old female patient presented with a persistent milky discharge from both nipples. The discharge is intermittent and can be expressed manually. She reports the involvement of multiple milk ducts, and her menstrual periods have been irregular for the past six months. The patient has a history of fertility issues and has been actively trying to conceive. She also experiences frequent headaches and has noticed some changes in her vision. No breast lumps have been detected, and she is not currently pregnant. A comprehensive assessment is warranted to determine the underlying cause of her galactorrhea, considering the presence of irregular menstrual periods, fertility issues, as well as the associated headaches and vision problems.",
  "Galactorrhea_2": "  Patient Description 2:\n  A 28-year-old female patient presented with a spontaneously leaked milky nipple discharge from her right breast. She has observed this discharge involving multiple milk ducts and has been experiencing occasional headaches. The patient's menstrual periods have been absent for the last three months, and she is not pregnant. She has no history of fertility issues, but she does report taking a new medication for anxiety, which could be a contributing factor. There is no associated breast pain or lumps. Given the medication side effects and the absence of menstrual periods, a comprehensive assessment is crucial to evaluate the potential impact of the medication and explore other underlying causes of her galactorrhea.",
  "Galactorrhea_3": "  Patient Description 3:\n  A 40-year-old female patient reported a milky discharge from her left nipple, which has been intermittent and manually expressible. She has a history of irregular menstrual periods and occasional headaches. The patient's vision has been affected, and she has noticed vision problems. There is no breast pain, but she previously had a benign breast lump, which was surgically removed. Her menstrual cycle irregularity has persisted despite the lump removal. A comprehensive assessment is necessary to investigate the persistent galactorrhea in the context of her history of irregular menstrual periods, prior breast lump, and the newly developed vision problems and headaches."
