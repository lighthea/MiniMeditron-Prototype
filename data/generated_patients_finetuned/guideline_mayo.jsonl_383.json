  "Factor V Leiden_1": "Patient A, a 32-year-old female, presents with persistent pain and swelling in her left leg, rated at 6/10 in intensity. The affected limb exhibits redness and warmth. Notably, she experienced sudden shortness of breath, accompanied by chest pain upon breathing in. Additionally, a cough producing bloody sputum and a rapid heartbeat have been reported. The patient's medical history is significant for the use of estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. No prior similar episodes have been documented in her family. Given the constellation of symptoms and the contextual information, further investigation is warranted to assess the likelihood of an underlying prothrombotic condition.",

The affected area shows redness and warmth. He also experienced a sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pain exacerbated by breathing, along with a cough that produced blood-streaked sputum. The patient's medical history is notable for a recent major surgery, during which he had extended periods of immobility. There is no family history of similar symptoms or coagulation disorders. Given the clinical presentation and the contextual information, an in-depth assessment is crucial to determine the underlying etiology of his condition.",
  "Factor V Leiden_3": "A 28-year-old female, Patient C, presented with a chief complaint of persistent pain in her left leg, rated at 6/10 in intensity, accompanied by swelling, redness, and warmth at the affected site. She reported a sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pain, which exacerbated during inspiration. Additionally, she had a cough that occasionally produced bloody sputum. The patient's medical history is unremarkable, with no prior surgeries, injuries, or family history of blood clots. However, she is currently using estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. Given the presented symptoms and the contextual information, a comprehensive diagnostic workup is essential to evaluate the potential underlying prothrombotic condition."
