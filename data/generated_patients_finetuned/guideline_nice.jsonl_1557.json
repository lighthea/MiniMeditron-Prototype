  "Colorectal cancer_1": "    Patient A, a 56-year-old male, presents with a complex constellation of symptoms suggestive of gastrointestinal pathology. The patient reports persistent jaundice, which he describes as moderate in intensity, accompanied by a notable loss of appetite and weight. He has also been experiencing frequent episodes of nausea and generalized tiredness, which he attributes to his diminished dietary intake. Notably, the patient has no significant medical history and has not undergone any prior gastrointestinal evaluations. Given the atypical nature of his symptoms and the concerning pattern of weight loss, further investigation is warranted to elucidate the underlying etiology and establish an accurate diagnosis.",
  "Colorectal cancer_2": "    Patient B, a 65-year-old female, seeks medical evaluation for a concerning set of symptoms related to her gastrointestinal health. She reports a distressing combination of jaundice, which she characterizes as severe, loss of appetite, and unintentional weight loss. These symptoms have been accompanied by persistent nausea and a pervasive sense of tiredness, significantly impacting her daily activities and quality of life. The patient's past medical history is notable for non-specific gastrointestinal complaints, which were managed conservatively. Given the persistence and severity of her current symptoms, a comprehensive diagnostic workup is essential to determine the underlying cause and formulate an appropriate management plan.",
  "Colorectal cancer_3": "    Patient C, a 60-year-old male, presents with a worrisome array of symptoms indicative of potential gastrointestinal pathology. He describes a persistent, though mild, jaundice, along with a noticeable loss of appetite and weight. The patient reports recurrent episodes of nausea and generalized tiredness, which he attributes to his dietary changes and diminished energy levels.

Further evaluation is imperative to discern the underlying etiology of his presentation and initiate timely intervention."
