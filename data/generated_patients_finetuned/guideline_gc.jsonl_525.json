  "Vestibular Schwannomas_1": "    **Patient Description 1:**\n    A 43-year-old male patient presented with a two-month history of persistent, high-pitched tinnitus in his left ear, which he rated as 7/10 in severity, significantly impacting his quality of life. Additionally, he experienced a sudden sensorineural hearing loss in the same ear, with a noticeable interaural difference in hearing at multiple contiguous frequencies, particularly at higher dB values. The patient has no history of ear infections, head trauma, or ototoxic medication use. His audiometric evaluation revealed a distinct interaural distinction, with the affected frequencies and dB values aligning with the diagnostic criteria for the condition. Further diagnostic workup is warranted to assess the nature and extent of the underlying pathology.",
  "Vestibular Schwannomas_2": "    **Patient Description 2:**\n    A 55-year-old female patient, with a history of sporadic tinnitus, reported a recent exacerbation of her left-ear ringing, describing it as a 6/10 in intensity. Alongside the tinnitus, she had an acute onset of sensorineural hearing loss in her left ear, which she rated at 5/10 in severity. Audiometric testing revealed a significant interaural difference at several contiguous frequencies, with higher dB values in the affected ear. Notably, the patient's occupational history involved long-term exposure to high levels of occupational noise. There is no reported history of ear trauma, ongoing otologic infections, or prior episodes of hearing loss. Given the observed interaural discrepancies, further evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying etiology of these symptoms.",
  "Vestibular Schwannomas_3": "    **Patient Description 3:**\n    A 60-year-old male patient presented with a six-month history of asymmetric tinnitus, which he described as a constant, high-pitched sound in his right ear, rated at 8/10 in intensity, often disturbing his sleep. He also noticed a sudden onset of sensorineural hearing loss in the same ear, with a perceived severity of 8/10. Audiometric testing revealed a notable interaural difference at multiple contiguous frequencies, particularly at higher dB values, indicative of the condition under consideration. The patient has no history of significant noise exposure, head trauma, or ototoxic medication use. Further diagnostic assessments are essential to characterize the extent and nature of the underlying pathology and guide appropriate management."
