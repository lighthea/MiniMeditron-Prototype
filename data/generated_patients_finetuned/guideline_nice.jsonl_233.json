  "Unequal leg length due to trauma, infection, hypoplasia, or dysplasia of the femur or tibial_1": "    Patient A, a 35-year-old male, presented with a noticeable limp favoring the right leg, which he reports has been gradually worsening over the past six months. He described the discomfort as a dull ache (3/10) in the right hip and knee, particularly after prolonged periods of standing or walking. The patient's functional ability has become limited, and he experiences difficulty with activities such as climbing stairs and running. His medical history is significant for a childhood femur fracture, which required surgical intervention. On examination, there is an observable inequality in leg length, with radiological evidence revealing adequate bone consolidation post-surgical repair.",
  "Unequal leg length due to trauma, infection, hypoplasia, or dysplasia of the femur or tibial_2": "\n    Patient B, a 22-year-old female, sought medical evaluation for a persistent limp and limited functional ability in her left leg. She reported a history of childhood trauma to her left femur, which was managed conservatively without surgical intervention. The patient described her pain as intermittent, with episodes of sharp discomfort (5/10) in the left hip and knee, exacerbated by strenuous physical activities. Additionally, she noted possible effects on her lower back and the contralateral leg. Physical examination demonstrated an obvious discrepancy in leg length. Radiological imaging revealed evidence of hypoplasia in the left femur, further implicating the underlying bone pathology.",
  "Unequal leg length due to trauma, infection, hypoplasia, or dysplasia of the femur or tibial_3": "\n    Patient C, a 45-year-old male, presented with a chronic limp and decreased functional ability in his right leg. He reported a history of recurrent bone infections in his right tibia during childhood, which had been successfully treated with prolonged antibiotic therapy. The patient described his pain as a persistent dull ache (4/10) in the right ankle and knee, often aggravated by changes in weather. He also experienced possible effects on the adjacent joints, with occasional stiffness and discomfort. Physical examination revealed an unequal leg length, and radiological findings indicated residual dysplasia in the right tibia, consistent with his past bone infection and treatment history."
