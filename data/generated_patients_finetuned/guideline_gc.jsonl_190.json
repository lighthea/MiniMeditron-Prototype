  "Metastatic Non-Castrate Prostate Cancer_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 62-year-old man with a significant medical history presented with symptoms indicative of high volume metastatic non-castrate prostate cancer. He reported persistent and severe bone pain, localized primarily in the lower back and hips, which he described as 8/10 in intensity and unresponsive to over-the-counter analgesics. The patient's PSA level was markedly elevated, and further diagnostic workup revealed a Gleason score of 9, as well as the presence of four or more bone metastases. Additionally, imaging studies confirmed measurable visceral disease in the form of liver and lung metastases. Given the patient's overall health status, as determined by the CHAARTED and STAMPEDE criteria, he is deemed fit for treatment with abiraterone.",
  "Metastatic Non-Castrate Prostate Cancer_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 74-year-old male, previously fit and active, presented with symptoms suggestive of lower-risk de novo metastatic prostate cancer. He had been experiencing mild but persistent bone pain, primarily in the hips and pelvis, with a reported intensity of 3/10 on the pain scale. The patient's PSA level was found to be elevated, and a bone scan revealed the presence of three bone metastases. Notably, his Gleason score was 7. Further imaging identified no visceral disease. This patient's presentation aligns with the lower-risk de novo metastatic prostate cancer category. Given his medical history and the diagnostic findings in relation to the AAD and AAP criteria, a treatment plan incorporating the appropriate management approach is being considered.",
  "Metastatic Non-Castrate Prostate Cancer_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 68-year-old man, with a history of prior localized prostate cancer managed with radiation therapy, presented with features of high-risk de novo metastatic disease. He reported a sudden onset of severe bone pain, which he described as 9/10 in intensity, localized in the spine and ribs. Laboratory analysis revealed a significantly elevated PSA level, and a bone scan showed widespread skeletal involvement with multiple lesions, including the presence of visceral metastases in the adrenal glands. The patient's Gleason score for the current disease was 10. Despite his prior history of prostate cancer, the nature of the current presentation aligns with de novo high volume metastatic non-castrate prostate cancer. The diagnostic and contextual information, as per the LATITUDE criteria, underscores the urgency for an individualized treatment approach in this case."
