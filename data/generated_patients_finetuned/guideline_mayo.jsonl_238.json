  "Colic_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 6-week-old male infant was brought in by his parents, who are first-time caregivers. The infant has been experiencing distressing symptoms consistent with colic. The parents reported frequent and prolonged bouts of crying, with episodes lasting for over three hours a day, occurring at least three days a week for the past four weeks. The crying episodes are intense, often resembling screams and seem to be expressions of pain. Despite the absence of hunger or the need for a diaper change, the infant continues to cry inconsolably. The parents noted extreme fussiness, even after the crying has subsided, and the timing of these episodes is predictable, usually in the evening. Additionally, they observed facial discoloration and body tension, such as skin flushing, stiffened legs, and a tense abdomen. The infant has shown some gas relief after passing gas, which is in line with the contextual information. No previous medical interventions have been attempted. The parents are eager to explore management options for their child's colic.",
  "Colic_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 7-week-old female infant, born full-term with no complications during delivery, was brought in by her parents, who have a family history of infantile colic. The infant has been exhibiting symptoms indicative of colic, as outlined in the structured medical guideline. She has been crying intensely for prolonged periods, exceeding three hours a day, for the past five weeks. The cries often resemble screams and seem unrelated to hunger or the need for a diaper change. Despite the parents' best efforts, the infant remains extremely fussy, even after the crying episodes subside, and these episodes typically occur in the evening, following a predictable pattern. The parents have observed facial discoloration, such as skin flushing, during these episodes. Additionally, the infant displays body tension, including stiffened legs and clenched fists, further supporting the diagnosis. The family history of colic is a notable contextual factor. No specific interventions have been initiated to address the infant's colic at this time.",
