  "Knee Osteoarthritis_1": "    Patient A, a 58-year-old male, presents with chronic knee pain localized to the medial aspect of the right knee, which he describes as 7/10 in intensity, and a noticeable decrease in the joint's function. The pain is exacerbated during weight-bearing activities and has been persisting for the past two years. Notably, the patient has a history of obesity, with a BMI of 32, and is currently undergoing treatment for diabetes. He has previously used opioids to manage the knee pain. Physical examination reveals crepitus on movement, limited range of motion, and joint tenderness. The constellation of symptoms, along with the contextual factors of elevated BMI, diabetes, and pre-operative opioid use, necessitates a comprehensive evaluation to determine the appropriate management approach for the patient's knee condition.",
  "Knee Osteoarthritis_2": "    Patient B, a 65-year-old female, seeks medical attention for bilateral knee discomfort. She reports a constant, dull ache in both knees, rated at 5/10 in intensity, which is associated with decreased function, particularly during stair climbing and prolonged standing. The symptoms have been progressively worsening over the last five years. The patient has a history of smoking. On examination, there is joint stiffness, crepitus, and mild effusion in both knee joints. The presence of pain, along with decreased function, in the context of a smoking history, necessitates a thorough assessment to determine the underlying etiology of the patient's knee symptoms.",
  "Knee Osteoarthritis_3": "    Patient C, a 60-year-old male, presents with recurrent right knee pain, scoring 6/10 in intensity, and a noticeable decrease in joint function. The pain is aggravated during weight-bearing activities and has been persistent for three years. The patient has a history of pre-operative opioid use to manage the knee discomfort. Physical examination reveals crepitus, limited range of motion, and joint tenderness localized to the affected knee. The combination of chronic pain, decreased function, and a background of pre-operative opioid use requires a comprehensive evaluation to formulate an effective management plan for the patient's knee condition."
