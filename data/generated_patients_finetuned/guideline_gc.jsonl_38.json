  "Acute Liver Failure_1": "    Patient A, a 34-year-old female with a history of recurrent herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections, presents with a constellation of concerning symptoms. She has been experiencing persistent and increasing upper right quadrant abdominal pain, rated at 7/10 in severity, accompanied by nausea and jaundice. Notably, her clinical presentation is characterized by high clinical suspicion for a viral etiology, including HSV and hepatitis E. Given her immunocompetent status, there is a low positive predictive value for Wilson disease. The patient denies any recent acetaminophen use. It is essential to consider autoimmune hepatitis in the diagnostic workup. Furthermore, the contextual factor of pregnancy must be taken into account when assessing her condition.",
  "Acute Liver Failure_2": "    Patient B, a 48-year-old male, is admitted with a worrisome clinical profile suggestive of acute liver failure. He has a history of recurrent herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections and reports experiencing severe upper right quadrant abdominal pain, which he rates at 8/10 in intensity, along with persistent nausea and jaundice. Given his immunocompetent status, there is a low positive predictive value for Wilson disease. The patient denies any recent acetaminophen use. High clinical suspicion exists for a viral etiology, including HSV and hepatitis E. The diagnostic workup should also consider autoimmune hepatitis, as well as any potential acetaminophen-associated liver injury.",
  "Acute Liver Failure_3": "    Patient C, a 22-year-old male, presents with concerning symptoms indicative of acute liver failure. He reports a notable history of recurrent herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections and describes his upper right quadrant abdominal pain as severe, with a pain score of 9/10. Nausea and jaundice are also prominent features of his clinical presentation. Given his immunocompetent status, there is a low positive predictive value for Wilson disease, and he denies any recent acetaminophen use. High clinical suspicion exists for a viral etiology, including HSV and hepatitis E. The diagnostic workup should also consider autoimmune hepatitis as a potential contributing factor to his condition."
