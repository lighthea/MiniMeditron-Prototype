  "Stroke Rehabilitation_1": "1. Patient Presentation:\nA 65-year-old male, with a history of hypertension, presented with a complex set of symptoms following a recent cerebrovascular event. He exhibits notable motor deficits, primarily affecting the right upper and lower extremities, with a reported pain level of 6/10. Additionally, he experiences dysphagia, which has necessitated the need for tube feeding. Cognitive impairments, including difficulties in attention and memory, have been observed during clinical assessments. The patient also manifests aphasia, making communication challenging. Spatial neglect is evident, with the patient showing little awareness of the right side of his environment. He has reported episodes of post-stroke depression, further complicating his rehabilitation journey.",
  "Stroke Rehabilitation_2": "2. Patient Description:\nA 70-year-old female, with a history of diabetes, was admitted for comprehensive stroke rehabilitation. The patient presents with motor deficits, characterized by weakness in her left upper and lower extremities. This weakness is associated with discomfort, with the patient rating her pain at 5/10. She also exhibits dysphagia, requiring close monitoring during oral intake. Cognitive impairments, particularly in executive function and attention, have been noted in neuropsychological assessments. Additionally, the patient experiences post-stroke anxiety, which has contributed to a heightened sense of unease and restlessness. Given her medical history, the management of her diabetes during rehabilitation is a crucial consideration.",
  "Stroke Rehabilitation_3": "3. Patient Case:\nA 55-year-old male, without significant medical history, was brought to our facility for post-stroke rehabilitation. The patient's motor deficits are prominently displayed, with pronounced weakness in the right upper and lower extremities, along with focal spasticity, resulting in a persistent pain level of 7/10. Dysphagia is also present, necessitating closely monitored oral intake. Cognitive impairments, specifically in memory and problem-solving skills, have been observed during clinical evaluations. The patient exhibits spatial neglect, showing a lack of attention to his left-side environment. Additionally, he experiences hemianopsia, further complicating his visual perception. The management of his severe chronic lower extremity spasticity is an essential aspect of his rehabilitation plan."
