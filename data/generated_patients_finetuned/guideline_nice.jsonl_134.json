  "Colorectal cancer_1": "    Case 1:\n    A 52-year-old male patient presented with a history of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), specifically ulcerative colitis, which has been managed with mesalamine for the past 10 years. The patient now reports a persistent change in bowel habits, including increased frequency of bloody stools and abdominal pain rated at 6/10 in intensity. He has also experienced unintentional weight loss of 15 pounds over the last three months. Despite the use of over-the-counter analgesics, the abdominal pain has not subsided. Given the patient's history of IBD and the new-onset alarming symptoms, further evaluation is warranted to rule out any underlying colorectal pathology, including adenomas or colorectal cancer.",
  "Colorectal cancer_2": "    Case 2:\n    A 60-year-old female patient, with a family history of colorectal adenomas, presented with recurrent episodes of rectal bleeding. She described the bleeding as moderate, occurring intermittently over the past six months. The patient's bowel habits have also changed, with increased constipation and a feeling of incomplete evacuation. These symptoms have led to a persistent discomfort in her lower abdomen, rated at 4/10 in intensity. Despite dietary modifications and the use of fiber supplements, her constipation has not improved. Given the family history of adenomas, the patient's persistent rectal bleeding, altered bowel habits, and lower abdominal discomfort, a thorough diagnostic workup is essential to assess the presence of adenomatous polyps or colorectal cancer.",
  "Colorectal cancer_3": "    Case 3:\n    A 45-year-old male patient, without a known history of colorectal diseases, presented with an abrupt onset of severe abdominal pain, which he rated at 9/10 in intensity. The pain is localized in the lower left quadrant and is associated with episodes of bloody diarrhea. Additionally, the patient has noticed a significant decrease in his appetite and an unintentional weight loss of 10 pounds over the last two months. Despite over-the-counter antidiarrheal medications, the bloody diarrhea persists, and the abdominal pain is incapacitating. The sudden and severe nature of the symptoms, along with the presence of bloody diarrhea and unexplained weight loss, raises concern for a potential underlying colorectal pathology, such as colorectal cancer. Urgent diagnostic evaluation and intervention are necessary to determine the cause of the patient's distress."
