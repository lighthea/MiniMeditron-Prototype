  "Camphor toxicity_2": "Patient Description 1:\nA 45-year-old male patient, with a history of occasional substance abuse, was brought to the emergency department by family members after they noticed his altered mental status. The patient is experiencing a high level of confusion, restlessness, and hallucinations, which have progressed over the past 12 hours. He complained of oral burning sensation and nausea. On examination, the characteristic odor of camphor was noted on his breath. There is evidence of CNS depression, as well as muscle fasciculations. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but given the history of substance abuse, intentional ingestion is suspected. Diagnostic assessment includes the need for an ECG, along with a thorough review to identify the presence of any co-ingestants.",
  "Camphor toxicity_3": "Patient Description 2:\nA 30-year-old female patient, without significant medical history, presented to the clinic with persistent nausea, vomiting, and oral burning sensation. She reported a recent episode of accidental ingestion of what she believed to be a small amount of camphor. The oral and epigastric symptoms are causing her moderate discomfort. The patient is also exhibiting mild confusion and restlessness. Given the reported ingestion, the characteristic odor of camphor, and her symptoms, camphor toxicity is highly suspected. It is crucial to assess the extent of toxicity, monitor the patient's respiratory status, and conduct an ECG to evaluate any cardiac involvement.",
  "Camphor toxicity_4": "Patient Description 3:\nA 55-year-old male patient, known to have a history of depression and psychiatric illness, was brought to the emergency department due to an altered level of consciousness and seizures. The patient's family reported that he had been using camphor oil as a part of alternative therapy for his depressive symptoms. On examination, the patient exhibited CNS depression, along with prolonged QRS and QTc intervals on ECG. There is also evidence of cardiomyopathy, which is concerning. The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and he is experiencing severe muscle fasciculations. It is evident that the camphor toxicity has led to a severe presentation in this patient, necessitating immediate intervention and close monitoring."
