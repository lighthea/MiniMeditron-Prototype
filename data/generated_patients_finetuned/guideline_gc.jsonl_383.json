  "Pediatric Myelomeningocele_1": "    Patient A, a 7-year-old child, presents with a complex medical history, including a surgically repaired myelomeningocele (MM). The patient has a history of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus, which has been managed with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Despite the corrective surgery, there has been a notable loss of ambulatory function, and the patient's neurocognitive development has shown particular challenges. Additionally, there is a persistent risk of wound infection at the site of the MM closure. Given the patient's history, the timing of MM closure and maternal factors have significantly influenced the clinical presentation. Ongoing multidisciplinary management is crucial to address the risk of recurrent tethered cord and inclusion cysts in this complex pediatric case.",
  "Pediatric Myelomeningocele_2": "    Patient B, a 9-year-old child, with a documented myelomeningocele (MM) presents with concerning symptoms. The patient's medical history is notable for a surgically repaired MM; however, they have developed recurrent tethered cord issues, leading to increased pain and a gradual loss of ambulatory function. The patient's neurocognitive development also presents challenges, which have been a source of parental concern. Focusing on the diagnostic process, the timing of MM closure has played a pivotal role in the presentation of symptoms. The risk of inclusion cysts further complicates the clinical picture. It is imperative to address these issues comprehensively and consider the impact of both maternal and fetal factors on the patient's condition.",
  "Pediatric Myelomeningocele_3": "    Patient C, a 6-year-old child, is being evaluated for a surgically repaired myelomeningocele (MM). The patient has a history of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus, which has required ongoing management. Despite prior interventions, the patient's neurocognitive development shows noticeable delays. Additionally, there is a persistent risk of wound infection at the MM closure site, which poses challenges for long-term care. The timing of MM closure and maternal factors have significantly influenced the patient's condition and the manifestation of symptoms. Furthermore, the risk of recurrent tethered cord and inclusion cysts adds complexity to the clinical management. A comprehensive approach is essential to address the multifaceted issues in this pediatric case."
