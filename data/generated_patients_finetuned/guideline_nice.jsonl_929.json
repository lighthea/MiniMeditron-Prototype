  "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)_1": "    Case 1:\n    A 45-year-old male patient, with a history of type 2 diabetes and obesity (BMI 32), presented with persistent dull pain in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen, rated at 4/10 on the pain scale. The pain is often accompanied by a feeling of abdominal fullness. The patient's medical history indicates insulin resistance and hypertension, for which he is currently on medication. Laboratory tests revealed elevated liver enzymes. Additionally, the patient has been found to have dyslipidemia. Given the patient's clinical presentation, including abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, and the presence of steatosis as indicated by elevated liver enzymes, further evaluation for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is warranted.",
  "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)_2": "    Case 2:\n    A 52-year-old female patient, without a history of diabetes, presented with a constellation of symptoms. She reported aching discomfort in the upper abdomen, rated at 3/10 in intensity, along with an ongoing struggle with abdominal obesity. The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension, which is controlled with medication. Laboratory investigations showed deranged liver function tests, indicating hepatic steatosis. The patient also has dyslipidemia. Given the presence of abdominal obesity, hypertension, and hepatic steatosis, along with her lipid profile, the clinical picture suggests a high likelihood of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).",
  "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)_3": "    Case 3:\n    A 50-year-old male patient with a BMI of 30, and a known history of metabolic syndrome, presented with a persistent, dull pain in the right upper abdomen, which he rated at 5/10 in severity. The pain is often associated with a sense of heaviness in the abdomen. The patient has insulin resistance and is being managed for type 2 diabetes. His medical records also indicate a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia. Laboratory tests revealed elevated liver enzymes. The presence of abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, and the documented hepatic steatosis, along with the patient's history of metabolic syndrome, point towards a probable diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Further evaluation and management in this regard are essential."
