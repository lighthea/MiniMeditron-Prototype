  "Flu (Influenza)_1": "**Patient Description 1:**\n    A 35-year-old male patient, with a history of seasonal influenza vaccination, presented with an abrupt onset of symptoms. He reported a high-grade fever of 101.5\u00b0F (38.6\u00b0C), which has persisted for the past 48 hours, accompanied by severe muscle aches and generalized body pain, rated at 7/10 on the pain scale. The patient experienced a non-productive cough and a mildly sore throat. Notably, he had traveled with a large tourist group recently. There were no reported cases of vomiting or diarrhea. The prevalent symptoms, coupled with the seasonal factor and recent travel history, indicate a strong suspicion of influenza.",
  "Flu (Influenza)_2": "**Patient Description 2:**\n    A 25-year-old female patient, unvaccinated for influenza, presented with flu-like symptoms. She reported a persistent cough, along with a moderately sore throat and a runny nose. The cough, rated at 5/10 in intensity, has been ongoing for the past three days. The patient also described muscle aches and body pains, which she rated at 6/10. There were no episodes of vomiting or diarrhea. The absence of vaccination and the onset of symptoms during the flu season elevate the index of suspicion for influenza.",
  "Flu (Influenza)_3": "**Patient Description 3:**\n    A 45-year-old male patient, with no history of influenza vaccination, visited the clinic with a constellation of symptoms. He described a severe sore throat, rated at 8/10 in intensity, and a persistent, productive cough. The cough has been accompanied by a runny nose and a low-grade fever of 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C). The patient reported muscle aches and body pains, which he rated at 9/10, severely impacting his daily activities. There were no episodes of vomiting or diarrhea. The combination of severe symptoms, lack of vaccination, and the presence of flu-like illness during the seasonal peak raises a strong suspicion of influenza."
