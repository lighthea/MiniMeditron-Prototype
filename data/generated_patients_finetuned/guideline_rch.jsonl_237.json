The patient has reported a noticeable sub-optimal absorption of the prescribed medication, as evidenced by a persistent level of pain that is higher than anticipated. Despite adherence to the prescribed dose, the patient has experienced adverse events such as local itching at the injection site. Clinically, the patient has also expressed a moderate level of discomfort (6/10 on the pain scale) at the injection sites, impacting his daily activities. The observed symptoms are not solely attributed to the medication volume but may also be influenced by the patient's lifestyle and the technique used for the intramuscular injections.",
