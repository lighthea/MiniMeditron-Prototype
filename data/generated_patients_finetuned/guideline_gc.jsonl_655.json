  "High energy lower extremity trauma_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    An adult male, aged 40, with a history of smoking, presented with a severe lower extremity trauma following a high-energy injury. The injury resulted in massive soft tissue and muscle damage, accompanied by a vascular injury, leading to limb ischemia. The patient reported an intensity of 8/10 for pain in the affected lower extremity. Despite previous attempts at local wound care, the wound showed poor healing, and the patient's overall physiological status was significantly impacted. The presence of psychosocial risk factors further complicated the case, necessitating a comprehensive assessment and management approach.",
  "High energy lower extremity trauma_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 28-year-old female patient, a chronic smoker, was admitted with a high-energy lower extremity trauma. The injury caused a severe HELET injury, resulting in massive soft tissue and muscle damage. The patient reported an ongoing, severe pain with a rating of 9/10 in the affected limb. Clinical evaluation revealed limb ischemia due to associated vascular injury. The cumulative burden of the limb injury was found to be substantial, and the duration of lower extremity ischemia was a concerning factor. The patient's smoking history added complexity to the case, requiring a comprehensive diagnostic and treatment strategy.",
  "High energy lower extremity trauma_3": "    Patient Description 3:\n    A 50-year-old male patient, known for a history of smoking, presented with a high-energy lower extremity trauma. The injury led to a severe HELET injury, massive soft tissue and muscle damage, and vascular involvement, resulting in limb ischemia. The patient reported a persistently high pain level, rated at 7/10 in the affected lower extremity. In addition to the physical trauma, the presence of psychosocial risk factors further complicated the patient's condition. The overall burden of injury, coupled with the influence of smoking, posed challenges in determining the most effective diagnostic and management approach for the patient's complex presentation."
