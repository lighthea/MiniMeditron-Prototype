  "Bell\"s Palsy_1": "    Patient 1, a 35-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes, presented with a sudden onset of facial paralysis on the left side, which progressed rapidly, reaching its peak within 48 hours. She reported a pain level of 3/10 around her left ear, which she described as a dull ache. The unilateral facial paresis was accompanied by difficulty in closing her left eye and drooping of the left corner of her mouth. No history of recent upper respiratory ailments or immune compromise was reported. Given the patient's age, the presence of diabetes, and the rapid onset of unilateral facial paralysis, Bell's Palsy is strongly indicated.",
  "Bell\"s Palsy_2": "    Patient 2, a 50-year-old male, sought medical attention for the abrupt onset of facial paralysis on the right side. He described the pain around his right ear as sharp, with a severity level of 6/10. The facial paresis progressed rapidly, reaching its peak within 24 hours. The patient had no history of diabetes, upper respiratory ailments, or immune compromise. His unilateral facial paralysis was also associated with drooping of the right corner of his mouth and difficulty in closing his right eye. Given the patient's age and the rapid onset of symptoms, Bell's Palsy is a significant consideration.",
  "Bell\"s Palsy_3": "    Patient 3, a 25-year-old male, reported sudden-onset facial paralysis on the left side, which reached its maximum severity within 72 hours. He described the pain around his left ear as a constant, dull ache, with a rating of 4/10. The unilateral facial paresis was not associated with any other neurological deficits. The patient had no significant medical history, and there was no apparent cause for the symptoms. Bell's Palsy is a strong diagnostic consideration in this young, otherwise healthy individual with rapid-onset unilateral facial paralysis."
