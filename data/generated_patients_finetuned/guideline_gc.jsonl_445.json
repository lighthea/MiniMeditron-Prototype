  "Donor screening prior to solid organ transplantation_1": "  Patient Description 1:\n  A 42-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use presented with recurrent episodes of fever and chills (temperature ranging from 100.4\u00b0F to 102.2\u00b0F) over the past six months. The febrile episodes were often accompanied by profuse sweating and generalized malaise. Blood cultures revealed intermittent bacterial infections, which were successfully treated with antibiotics. Given the patient's history of high-risk behavior and the recurrent nature of his febrile episodes, a comprehensive evaluation is essential to assess the presence of any underlying bacterial, viral, or fungal infections. The type of infection, along with the geographic location and endemicity, will significantly impact the diagnostic workup for this potential solid organ transplant donor.",
  "Donor screening prior to solid organ transplantation_2": "Patient Description 2:\n  A 28-year-old female potential organ donor, who resides in a region with a high prevalence of parasitic infections, presented for pre-transplant screening. She reported a history of travel to tropical regions and outdoor activities. The patient complained of intermittent gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea with occasional blood in the stool. Stool examinations revealed the presence of parasitic infections, which had been previously treated with antiparasitic medication. However, the gastrointestinal symptoms persisted, albeit at a lower frequency. Given the donor's geographic exposure and the history of parasitic infections, a comprehensive assessment is crucial to evaluate the impact of these infections on her suitability as a solid organ donor.",
  "Donor screening prior to solid organ transplantation_3": "Patient Description 3:\n  A 50-year-old deceased donor candidate with a past medical history of recurrent respiratory tract infections and a smoking habit presented for pre-transplant screening. The donor's family reported multiple episodes of chronic cough, purulent sputum production, and dyspnea over the years. Chest imaging revealed recurrent pulmonary infiltrates consistent with fungal infections, for which the donor had received multiple courses of antifungal therapy. Despite treatment, the respiratory symptoms persisted, and the donor eventually succumbed to a respiratory failure unrelated to the transplant evaluation. The nature of the fungal infections, the deceased donor's medical history, and the chronicity of respiratory symptoms necessitate a thorough assessment of the potential impact on organ suitability for transplantation."
