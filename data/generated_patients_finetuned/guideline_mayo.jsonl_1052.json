  "Umbilical hernia_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 9-month-old infant was brought in for evaluation with a noticeable soft swelling or bulge adjacent to the umbilicus. The parents reported that the bulge becomes more prominent when the baby cries or strains during bowel movements. The infant's medical history is unremarkable, and there are no signs of pain, tenderness, or discoloration at the hernia site. Given the age factor and the characteristic presentation, a diagnosis of umbilical hernia, which is common in infants, is highly probable. Close monitoring has been advised to track the hernia's progression, as spontaneous closure often occurs in this age group.",
  "Umbilical hernia_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 34-year-old female presented with a persistent soft swelling near her navel, accompanied by abdominal discomfort. She described a dragging sensation in the affected area, with intermittent episodes of pain that she rated as 4 on a scale of 10. The patient has no significant medical history or prior abdominal surgeries. Physical examination revealed a visible bulge, and tenderness was elicited upon palpation. These findings, along with the presence of abdominal discomfort, raise concerns regarding an umbilical hernia in this adult patient. Further diagnostic evaluation, including abdominal ultrasound, has been scheduled to assess the hernia's size and determine the need for surgical intervention.",
  "Umbilical hernia_3": "    Patient Description 3:\n    A 57-year-old male with a history of obesity and chronic cough presented to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain localized around his navel. He described the pain as severe, with a score of 8 on a pain scale, and noted associated swelling and discoloration at the site of his umbilicus. The patient's medical background included hypertension and a sedentary lifestyle. Physical examination revealed a tender, irreducible umbilical hernia with evident discoloration. Given the presence of severe pain, tenderness, and discoloration at the hernia site, this constitutes a surgical emergency. An urgent abdominal CT scan was performed to assess the extent of tissue damage and guide appropriate interventions."
