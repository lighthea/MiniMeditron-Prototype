He described the pain as aching and rated it at 5/10 in severity, exacerbated by coughing and prolonged standing. The patient also noted a sense of heaviness and weakness in the affected groin. Physical examination revealed a discernible bulge in the groin area, more noticeable on the left side, which corresponded to his symptoms. No signs of strangulation, such as discoloration of the bulge, were observed.",
  "Inguinal Hernia_3": "Patient Description 3:\nThe parents of a 5-month-old male infant brought him to the clinic due to increased irritability and decreased appetite over the past week. On further inquiry, they mentioned a visible bulge in the baby's groin, especially when he cried or strained during bowel movements. The infant had no history of fever or vomiting. On examination, a non-tender, reducible inguinal bulge was noted, accompanied by the infant's fussiness during the assessment. The parents reported that the bulge had been present since birth but seemed more pronounced recently, correlating with the infant's fussiness and feeding difficulties."
