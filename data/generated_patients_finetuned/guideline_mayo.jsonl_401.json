  "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)_1": "1. Patient Description 1:\n   A 42-year-old male patient, with a medical history significant for obesity and a family history of renal disease, presented with a concerning progression of symptoms. Over the past six months, he has reported a noticeable increase in lower extremity edema, particularly in the legs and ankles, which he describes as both uncomfortable and tender. The patient's blood pressure has been consistently elevated, despite lifestyle modifications. Laboratory tests revealed worsening kidney function, indicated by a declining glomerular filtration rate and persistent proteinuria with a daily protein excretion of 3.5 grams. Given the familial history and the observed clinical picture, further investigations are warranted to determine the type of FSGS and assess possible underlying genetic factors contributing to this presentation.",
  "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)_2": "2. Patient Description 2:\n   A 35-year-old female patient, non-smoker, and with no significant past medical history, presented with a complex set of symptoms. She reported a three-month history of generalized edema, most prominently in her legs and ankles, associated with a sensation of heaviness and discomfort. The patient's blood pressure has been intermittently elevated, and urinalysis revealed significant proteinuria, averaging 2.8 grams per day. Despite adopting dietary changes, the protein leakage persists. Her kidney function has shown a downward trend, as evidenced by a progressive increase in serum creatinine levels. Given the absence of known risk factors, the diagnostic workup needs to determine the type of FSGS and explore potential underlying conditions contributing to her presentation.",
  "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)_3": "3. Patient Description 3:\n   A 50-year-old male patient, with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity, presented with a concerning constellation of symptoms. He described a six-month history of bilateral leg and ankle edema, which he rated as moderately painful (6/10 on a pain scale) and refractory to diuretic therapy. The patient's blood pressure has been difficult to control despite optimal medical management. Laboratory findings revealed persistent, significant proteinuria, with a daily excretion of 4 grams, and a progressive decline in kidney function, as indicated by rising serum creatinine levels. The presence of underlying conditions complicates the diagnostic process, and it is crucial to determine the type of FSGS and assess the impact of comorbidities on the patient's clinical presentation."
