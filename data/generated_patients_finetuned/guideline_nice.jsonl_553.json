  "Intracranial aneurysms_1": "    **Case 1:**\n    A 45-year-old female, with a history of smoking, presents with severe, persistent headaches, which she describes as pulsating and localized to the frontal and temporal regions. The pain is frequently accompanied by nausea and photophobia. She reports no previous history of such headaches and emphasizes their sudden onset and escalating intensity over the past two weeks. The patient's neurological examination is unremarkable at this stage, but given the risk of rupture in the context of her symptoms and lifestyle factors, further diagnostic evaluation is warranted.",
  "Intracranial aneurysms_2": "    **Case 2:**\n    A 55-year-old male, known for his hypertension, arrives with a history of episodic severe headaches. He describes the pain as excruciating, often reaching a 9/10 intensity, concentrated behind his eyes, and accompanied by brief episodes of double vision. These headaches have been occurring intermittently for the last six months. Additionally, the patient reports a recent episode of subarachnoid hemorrhage, characterized by a sudden, severe headache, coupled with nausea and loss of consciousness. Despite the subsidence of the bleeding, he continues to experience persistent, mild neurological deficits, such as subtle speech difficulties and intermittent mild weakness in his right hand. Given these symptoms and the history of subarachnoid hemorrhage, urgent diagnostic measures are required.",
  "Intracranial aneurysms_3": "    **Case 3:**\n    A 50-year-old man presents with a persistent, moderately severe headache, scoring 6/10 in intensity, that has been ongoing for the past three weeks. He describes the pain as constant, situated at the back of his head, and often accompanied by a feeling of \"pulsing.\" The patient has a family history of intracranial aneurysms. Neurological examination reveals a persistent, mild impairment in his speech fluency and word-finding abilities, which has been progressively worsening over the last month. Given the patient's family history and the persistence of his symptoms, further diagnostic work-up is crucial to evaluate the underlying cause of his condition and determine an appropriate course of action."
