  "Epididymitis_1": "    Patient A, a 35-year-old male, presents with a gradual onset of constant, dull testicle pain rated at 6/10 in severity, localized to the left side, accompanied by scrotal swelling and warmth. He also reports a persistent, 7/10 pain during urination, along with a frequent and urgent need to urinate. Additionally, he has noticed a penile discharge. The patient's medical history is significant for multiple sexual partners and a recent history of unprotected sexual activity. Physical examination reveals an enlarged left inguinal lymph node. These findings, in conjunction with the patient's contextual information, indicate a strong possibility of a genitourinary condition, necessitating a comprehensive diagnostic workup.",
  "Epididymitis_2": "    Patient B, a 28-year-old male, presents with an acute onset of severe right testicular pain, which he describes as sharp and stabbing, with a pain score of 9/10. The pain has been progressively increasing over the past 48 hours and is associated with redness and warmth in the scrotal area. He also reports a 6/10 pain during urination and an urgent need to urinate. There is no history of recent sexual activity, but the patient does engage in heavy lifting as part of his occupation. His vital signs are remarkable for a low-grade fever. The constellation of symptoms, including scrotal findings, urinary complaints, and fever, along with the patient's history of heavy lifting, raises concerns for a specific genitourinary condition, prompting the need for a thorough diagnostic evaluation.",
  "Epididymitis_3": "    Patient C, a 50-year-old male, presents with a persistent, 4/10 aching pain in the lower abdomen and pelvic area, which he has been experiencing for the past two weeks. He also reports a mild, intermittent discomfort in the scrotum, without significant redness or warmth. The patient's urination is frequently accompanied by a 5/10 pain, and he has noticed blood in his semen. His medical history is notable for a prior episode of urinary tract infection. There is no history of recent sexual activity or heavy lifting. Physical examination reveals no palpable lymphadenopathy. Given the patient's age, recurrent urinary tract infections, and the presence of blood in the semen, a comprehensive diagnostic assessment is warranted to elucidate the underlying etiology of his symptoms."
