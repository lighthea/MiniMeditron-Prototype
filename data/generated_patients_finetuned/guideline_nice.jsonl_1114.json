  "Primary hyperhidrosis of the upper limb_1": "    Patient A, a 28-year-old office worker, presents with a chronic and distressing issue of excessive sweating localized to the palms and axillae. This condition has significantly impacted the patient's quality of life, leading to noticeable social discomfort and professional limitations. Despite attempting various first-line management treatments, including topical antiperspirants and lifestyle modifications, the symptoms persist, with a severity that the patient describes as 8/10 in terms of distress and interference with daily activities. The duration of this primary hyperhidrosis of the upper limb has been more than two years. The diagnostic assessment should consider the profound impact of the symptoms on the patient's occupational and psychosocial well-being, as well as the limited response to initial management strategies.",

Despite diligent attempts at using topical antiperspirants and adjusting lifestyle factors, the excessive sweating remains unabated, significantly impacting the patient's personal and professional life.

  "Primary hyperhidrosis of the upper limb_3": "    Patient C, a 30-year-old individual, reports a longstanding problem of excessive sweating localized to the palms and axillae. The symptoms, which have persisted for three years, are described by the patient as highly distressing, with a severity rating of 9/10, leading to frequent embarrassment and lifestyle modifications. Despite consistent use of topical antiperspirants and various self-management strategies, the excessive sweating remains uncontrolled, profoundly affecting the patient's social interactions and emotional well-being.
