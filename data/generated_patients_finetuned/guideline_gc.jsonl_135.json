  "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex_1": "   Patient A, a 4-year-old child, presents with a complex medical history and a constellation of concerning symptoms. The most notable issue is the presence of tubers in the brain, as revealed by a recent MRI. The patient's caregivers have also observed focal seizures and infantile spasms, which have been increasingly frequent, with an average pain level of 6 on a scale of 0 to 10. Additionally, there are indications of TAND, including language disorders and behavioral changes. Given the family history of neurological conditions, genetic testing is warranted. A comprehensive evaluation including routine EEG, detailed clinical dermatologic and dental inspections, and a complete ophthalmologic assessment is essential to form a cohesive diagnostic approach for this complex presentation.",
  "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex_2": "   Patient B, a 25-year-old woman, comes to the clinic with a history of episodic dyspnea, cough, and recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax. Imaging studies have revealed pulmonary manifestations, and she also reports a chronic, dull chest pain (rated at 4/10) localized to the left side. Further evaluation shows the presence of angiomyolipomas and renal cysts, raising concerns about Tuberous Sclerosis Complex. A detailed assessment, including MRI of the abdomen, blood pressure monitoring, and renal function determination, is necessary to characterize the extent of visceral involvement and guide the diagnostic process.",
  "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex_3": "   Patient C, a 6-year-old boy, is brought in by his parents due to academic difficulties and a recent onset of seizures. The seizures are characterized by generalized tonic-clonic activity and have a significant impact on the child's well-being, with a reported pain level of 7/10. A three-generation family history reveals a pattern of neurodevelopmental disorders. The patient also exhibits behavioral changes, as well as an achromic patch on the skin, prompting a comprehensive evaluation. Utilizing genetic testing, MRI of the brain, and EEG, along with a detailed clinical assessment, is essential to elucidate the underlying etiology of his symptoms and guide the management of his condition."
