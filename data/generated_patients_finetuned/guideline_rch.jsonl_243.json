  "Infantile spasms (IS)_1": "  Description 1:\nA 5-month-old male infant, previously healthy with no notable perinatal history, was brought in by his parents due to concerning episodes. The parents described sudden, brief, and clustered muscle contractions involving the neck, trunk, and extremities. These episodes were bilateral and symmetric, often accompanied by head nodding and noticeable facial or eye movements. The infant's Peak age of onset aligns with the typical presentation of Infantile Spasms (IS), and a review of parental video recordings further supports this observation. Given the association with developmental delay in a majority of infants with IS, a comprehensive developmental assessment is warranted. Further evaluation is crucial to determine the underlying etiology and initiate appropriate treatment.",
  "Infantile spasms (IS)_2": "  Description 2:\nWe assessed a 6-month-old female infant with a history of trisomy 21, presenting with concerning episodes characterized by sudden, bilateral, and symmetric muscle contractions involving the neck, trunk, and extremities. These spasms occur in clusters and are often accompanied by head nodding and facial or eye movements, consistent with the classic symptoms of Infantile Spasms (IS). The peak age of onset for IS aligns with the infant's age, and the association with trisomy 21 as a common underlying cause further raises diagnostic consideration. A thorough diagnostic workup, including EEG evaluation, is imperative to confirm the diagnosis and assess the presence of hypsarrhythmia. Given the increased risk of developmental delay in infants with IS and trisomy 21, early intervention and treatment planning are essential.",
  "Infantile spasms (IS)_3": "  Description 3:\nA 4-month-old male infant, born at term with a history of perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), was brought to our attention due to recurrent episodes of sudden, brief, and clustered muscle contractions involving the neck, trunk, and extremities. These spasms are bilateral and symmetric, often accompanied by head nodding and facial or eye movements. The infant's perinatal HIE adds complexity to the presentation, as it is a known associated factor with Infantile Spasms (IS). The peak age of onset for IS aligns with the infant's age, and the history of HIE further complicates the etiological assessment. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including EEG and neuroimaging, is crucial to confirm the diagnosis, assess the presence of hypsarrhythmia, and investigate any focal structural abnormalities. Early intervention and close monitoring are paramount, given the high risk of developmental delay associated with IS, particularly in the context of perinatal HIE."
