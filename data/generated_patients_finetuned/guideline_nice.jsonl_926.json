  "Atrial fibrillation_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    \n    A 52-year-old male patient, with a notable medical history of hypertension, presented with concerning cardiac symptoms. He reported frequent palpitations, which he described as an \"uncomfortable fluttering\" in his chest, escalating to a level of 7/10 in intensity and often lasting for prolonged periods. The palpitations were accompanied by episodic dizziness (3/10) and occasional chest pain (5/10). Additionally, the patient experienced intermittent shortness of breath, particularly during moderate physical exertion. He noted a persistent fatigue despite sufficient rest. Given the patient's age, gender, and medical history, risk stratification for the observed symptoms is crucial.",
  "Atrial fibrillation_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    \n    A 64-year-old female patient, previously diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, presented with a complex array of symptoms suggestive of a cardiac pathology. The patient reported recurrent palpitations, which she described as \"racing heartbeats,\" often peaking at an intensity level of 8/10 and lasting for extended durations. These palpitations were accompanied by frequent episodes of dizziness (6/10) and a sensation of shortness of breath during physical activities. The patient also complained of intermittent chest pain, rated at 4/10 in intensity. Despite her thyroid condition being managed, she continued to experience persistent fatigue. Given the patient's age, gender, and medical history, a comprehensive evaluation with a focus on risk stratification is imperative.",
