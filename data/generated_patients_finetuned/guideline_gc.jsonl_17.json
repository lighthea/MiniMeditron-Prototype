  "Acute Leukemia_1": "    **Patient Description 1:**\n    A 34-year-old male patient presents with a complex medical history, including a prior diagnosis of acute leukemia. The current symptoms are indicative of disease relapse, characterized by a high disease burden and persistent MRD positivity. The patient has undergone induction chemotherapy but remains MRD positive, warranting the consideration of blinatumomab therapy. However, the availability of this treatment modality may impact the diagnostic and therapeutic process. Given the poor outcomes associated with MRD-positive status, enrollment in a clinical trial is strongly recommended to strive for an MRD-negative status and improve prognosis.",
  "Acute Leukemia_2": "    **Patient Description 2:**\n    A 45-year-old female patient with a history of B-ALL presents with relapsed disease and a high disease burden. The diagnostic process is influenced by the availability of treatment options, with inotuzumab ozogamicin being a primary consideration due to the disease's aggressive nature. However, the patient's candidacy for subsequent allo-HCT necessitates careful management, as inotuzumab ozogamicin usage may increase the risk of SOS/VOD in the transplant setting. Therefore, the number of treatment cycles should be limited if allo-HCT is planned. The medical team must weigh the benefits of inotuzumab ozogamicin against the potential complications in the context of the patient's overall treatment plan.",
  "Acute Leukemia_3": "    **Patient Description 3:**\n    A 55-year-old male patient, newly diagnosed with AML, is ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy. Given the patient's specific clinical profile, the use of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) should be considered as a first-line therapy. The availability of GO may impact the diagnostic process and initial treatment decisions. As the field of leukemia therapeutics continues to evolve, there is a need for further studies to identify optimal therapeutic options for patients in similar scenarios, especially those ineligible for standard intensive chemotherapy. The patient's management will require a tailored approach, taking into account both disease-specific factors and treatment availability."
