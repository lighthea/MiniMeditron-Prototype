  "Seasonal Affective Disorder_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 32-year-old female, with a family history of depression, presented with a persistent low mood, fatigue, and feelings of hopelessness for the past two consecutive winters. She reported a notable loss of interest in activities she once enjoyed and a significant increase in carbohydrate cravings, leading to overeating and subsequent weight gain. The patient also described experiencing trouble sleeping, with a pattern of oversleeping and feeling sluggish throughout the day. Her concentration has noticeably declined, and she often feels guilty about her perceived lack of productivity. The diagnostic evaluation should consider the possibility of Seasonal Affective Disorder, taking into account the patient's family history and the recurrent nature of her symptoms during the winter months.",
  "Seasonal Affective Disorder_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 45-year-old male, residing in a location with limited sunlight exposure, presented with a combination of symptoms, including low mood, decreased energy levels, and noticeable weight gain. The patient reported feeling listless and sad, with a persistent craving for high-carbohydrate foods, leading to overeating and subsequent weight gain of 15 pounds over the past two months. He also described trouble sleeping, often oversleeping and feeling excessively tired during the day. Additionally, the patient reported difficulty concentrating and a sense of hopelessness. A diagnostic assessment should consider Seasonal Affective Disorder, given the patient's geographical location, weight changes, and the observed impact of these symptoms on his daily functioning.",
  "Seasonal Affective Disorder_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 28-year-old female, with a history of bipolar disorder, presented with a recurrent pattern of symptoms marked by low mood, fatigue, and increased irritability during the winter months. The patient reported a significant change in her sleep patterns, characterized by trouble sleeping and insomnia, as well as a noticeable decrease in her energy levels. She described a persistent craving for carbohydrates, leading to overeating and subsequent weight gain, which has been particularly evident in the winter season. The patient's family history of bipolar disorder further complicates the diagnostic evaluation, requiring a comprehensive assessment to differentiate between Seasonal Affective Disorder and the potential influence of her underlying bipolar condition."
