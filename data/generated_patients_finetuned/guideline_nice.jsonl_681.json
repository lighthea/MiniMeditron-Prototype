  "Fracture non-union_1": "    Description 1:\n    A 62-year-old female patient, with a history of diabetes and a previous fracture in her left tibia, presented with persistent localized pain at the fracture site. Despite the injury occurring over 9 months ago, there has been a failure of bony union, and the patient continues to experience discomfort with a pain level of 6/10. Notably, the patient is a smoker. The diagnostic evaluation should consider the impact of systemic medical conditions, smoking, and the history of diabetes on the non-union of the fracture.",
  "Fracture non-union_2": "    Description 2:\n    A 55-year-old male patient, who sustained a significant injury to his right arm 8 months ago, is experiencing ongoing pain at the fracture site, rated at 7/10. The radiographic assessment reveals a failure of bony union. The patient does not have a history of systemic medical conditions, but he is a chronic user of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The diagnostic workup should take into account the influence of the magnitude of the initial injury and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the non-union of the fracture.",
  "Fracture non-union_3": "    Description 3:\n    An 70-year-old male patient, with a history of osteoporosis, presented with a non-healing fracture in his left femur, which occurred 10 months ago. The patient's pain at the fracture site is persistent, with a severity of 5/10. Radiographic examination confirms the failure of bony union. Given the patient's advanced age and the presence of osteoporosis, these systemic medical conditions are pertinent factors in the diagnostic assessment of the non-union of the fracture. Additionally, the influence of osteoporosis on the fracture non-union should be carefully considered."
