  "Knee bursitis_1": "    Patient A, a 45-year-old avid runner, presents with a persisting issue in the left knee. The affected knee exhibits notable warmth, tenderness, and swelling, with the patient reporting a pain level of 6/10 during movement and 4/10 at rest. These symptoms have been gradually worsening over the past six weeks and are significantly impeding the patient's running routine. Notably, the presence of a low-grade fever has been observed. Despite prior attempts at home care, including rest and ice application, the condition has shown no signs of improvement. Given the constellation of symptoms and the contextual presence of fever, further evaluation is warranted to determine the underlying cause and formulate an appropriate treatment plan.",
  "Knee bursitis_2": "    Patient B, a 60-year-old individual with a history of osteoarthritis, seeks medical assessment for a troublesome knee issue. The patient describes a persistent, warm, and tender swelling in the right knee, accompanied by a consistent pain rating of 5/10, both during movement and at rest. These symptoms have been ongoing for approximately three months and have limited the patient's mobility, particularly when navigating stairs or prolonged standing. Notably, there is an absence of fever. Despite the use of over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications, the condition has not shown significant improvement. Given the patient's history of osteoarthritis and the characteristic presentation of knee bursitis, further evaluation is crucial to confirm the diagnosis and optimize management.",
  "Knee bursitis_3": "    Patient C, a 30-year-old individual with no significant medical history, reports a concerning issue with the left knee. The patient experiences localized warmth, tenderness, and swelling in the affected knee, coupled with a persistent pain level of 7/10 during movement and 3/10 at rest. These symptoms have been present for four weeks and have interfered with the patient's work, which involves frequent kneeling and squatting. There is no fever reported. The patient has attempted home remedies, including rest and elevation, with minimal relief. Given the persistent nature of the symptoms and their impact on the patient's occupational functions, a comprehensive evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying cause of the knee discomfort and institute an effective treatment plan."
