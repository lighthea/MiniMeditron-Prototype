  "Hurthle cell cancer_1": "Patient A, a 45-year-old male with a history of thyroid nodules, presented with a palpable lump in his neck, localized just below the Adam's apple. The patient reported a persistent, dull pain in the neck, rated at 4/10 in intensity. Additionally, he complained of intermittent hoarseness and noted a significant change in his voice quality. Notably, he has experienced episodes of shortness of breath and mild difficulty in swallowing. Given the presence of these symptoms, coupled with the patient's history of thyroid nodules, further evaluation is warranted to determine the underlying etiology and guide appropriate management.",
  "Hurthle cell cancer_2": "Patient B, a 55-year-old female, sought medical attention for a bothersome lump in her neck, specifically located below the Adam's apple. She described the associated neck and throat pain as sharp and intermittent, with intensity ranging from 3 to 6 out of 10. The pain episodes were often exacerbated during swallowing. The patient also reported persistent hoarseness in her voice and observed noticeable changes in vocal quality. She denied any respiratory issues but frequently experienced mild discomfort and difficulty while swallowing solid foods. Given the constellation of these symptoms, along with the presence of the neck lump, further diagnostic assessment is crucial to elucidate the underlying pathology and formulate an appropriate management plan.",
  "Hurthle cell cancer_3": "Patient C, a 50-year-old male with no significant medical history, presented with a palpable lump in his neck, situated below the Adam's apple. He described the associated neck and throat pain as persistent and rated the intensity at 5/10. The pain was exacerbated during swallowing and speaking. The patient also reported persistent hoarseness and a discernible change in his voice. He had noticed episodes of shortness of breath, especially during physical exertion, and mild difficulty in swallowing solid foods. Given the presence of these symptoms, further diagnostic investigation is imperative to determine the nature of the neck lump and its associated clinical implications. The patient's lack of medical history underscores the importance of a comprehensive evaluation in this context."
