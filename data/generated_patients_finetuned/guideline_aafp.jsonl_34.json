  "ADHD in Children and Adolescents_1": "  Patient Description 1:\n  A 9-year-old male patient, with no significant medical history, was brought in by his parents due to concerning academic and behavioral issues. The parents reported persistent inattention during schoolwork and homework, with the child often making careless mistakes and struggling to sustain attention. Additionally, they observed marked hyperactivity and impulsivity, both at home and in school. These behaviors have been ongoing for at least six months, and they are significantly impacting the child's academic performance and social interactions. The parents also recounted similar observations from the child's teachers. The family history is unremarkable for neurodevelopmental disorders. No alternative causes for these behaviors have been identified thus far.",
  "ADHD in Children and Adolescents_2": "Patient Description 2:\n  A 13-year-old female patient, with a history of developmental delay, was evaluated for academic and behavioral difficulties. The patient has been experiencing challenges with organization and completing tasks, as well as difficulty following instructions. Both parents and teachers have noticed her inattention, which has persisted for over six months. In addition to academic struggles, she displays hyperactive and impulsive behaviors, often interrupting others and having difficulty engaging in leisure activities quietly. These symptoms are notably affecting her daily functioning, and the presence of developmental delay adds complexity to the diagnostic process. No other behavioral or emotional disorders have been identified. The patient's medical history is significant for delayed developmental milestones.",
  "ADHD in Children and Adolescents_3": "Patient Description 3:\n  A 7-year-old male patient, from a low-income urban neighborhood, presented with academic and behavioral problems. His parents reported persistent inattention, difficulty focusing on school assignments, and a high level of hyperactivity. These symptoms have been present for some time, and the child's academic performance is notably impaired. The family has limited access to healthcare resources, and there is no known family history of neurodevelopmental disorders. The parents expressed concern about the child's impulsivity, which is evident both at home and in the classroom. The patient's teachers have also noted these behaviors. Given the socioeconomic context, comprehensive assessment and access to appropriate care pose significant challenges. The initial focus is on ruling out alternative causes for the observed academic and behavioral issues.\n"
