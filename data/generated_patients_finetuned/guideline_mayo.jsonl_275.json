  "Nonmelanoma skin cancer_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 58-year-old male patient presented with a persistent, non-healing ulcer on his left temple, which has been gradually increasing in size over the past six months. The ulcer is accompanied by intermittent bleeding and has reached a diameter of 2 centimeters. The patient reported a history of chronic sun exposure due to outdoor occupation. Physical examination revealed a raised, pearly border with areas of crusting on the ulcer. The patient's pain level, measured at 3/10, is characterized as mild and intermittent. Given the location of the ulcer and the chronic sun exposure history, the diagnostic evaluation should focus on differentiating between basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.",
  "Nonmelanoma skin cancer_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 72-year-old female patient with a medical history of extensive sun exposure and multiple episodes of sunburns, presented with a rapidly growing, red-violet nodule on her upper back. The nodule measures 2.5 centimeters in diameter and is associated with localized tenderness, with the patient reporting a pain level of 5/10, described as aching and persistent. Dermatological examination revealed the nodule to have irregular borders and varied coloration. Given the acute onset, rapid growth, and the patient's sun exposure history, the diagnostic workup should prioritize differentiating between angiosarcoma and other forms of nonmelanoma skin cancer.",
  "Nonmelanoma skin cancer_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 65-year-old male patient, with a history of working in chemical factories, presented with a firm, painless nodule on his left forearm, which has been slowly enlarging over the past year. The nodule, measuring 3 centimeters in diameter, exhibits a bluish discoloration and is fixed to the underlying tissues. The patient denied any history of significant sun exposure but reported prolonged occupational exposure to chemical agents. Physical examination also revealed multiple smaller nodules in the adjacent area. Given the clinical presentation and occupational history, the primary diagnostic consideration should be to differentiate between dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and other types of nonmelanoma skin cancer."
