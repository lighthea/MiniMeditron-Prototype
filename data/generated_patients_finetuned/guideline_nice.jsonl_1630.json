  "Respiratory or cardiac failure in postneonatal children that is unresponsive to all other measures but is considered to have a reversible cause._1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 14-month-old male child, with no significant medical history, is presenting with a complex set of symptoms. The patient was brought in by the parent with a high-grade fever, persistent cough, and labored breathing. Physical examination revealed crackles in the lung fields, and the child appeared lethargic. Despite receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy, the fever persisted, and the respiratory distress worsened over the past 48 hours. The child's oxygen saturation levels have declined to 88% on room air, and additional oxygen support was initiated. Diagnostic evaluation is challenging due to the child's age, but given the unresponsiveness to standard treatments for pneumonia, the presence of severe respiratory symptoms, and the failure to improve with antibiotics, a comprehensive workup is imperative to determine the underlying etiology and guide further management.",
  "Respiratory or cardiac failure in postneonatal children that is unresponsive to all other measures but is considered to have a reversible cause._2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 6-week-old female infant, born full-term with an unremarkable perinatal history, is currently admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. The infant's clinical presentation is marked by a constellation of concerning symptoms. The parents reported a recent onset of poor feeding, irritability, and persistent tachypnea. On examination, the infant appeared pale, and auscultation revealed a systolic murmur. Despite nutritional support and close monitoring, the infant's respiratory rate has been consistently elevated, and she has developed episodes of desaturation. Echocardiography demonstrated the presence of congenital heart disease, but the infant's clinical status continues to deteriorate, posing a diagnostic and management challenge. Further assessment is required to elucidate the extent of cardiac involvement and guide the most appropriate therapeutic interventions.",
  "Respiratory or cardiac failure in postneonatal children that is unresponsive to all other measures but is considered to have a reversible cause._3": "    Patient Description 3:\n    A 9-month-old male infant, with a history of prematurity and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome requiring ventilatory support, is presenting with a complex clinical picture. The infant sustained accidental thermal injuries two weeks ago and was managed appropriately with wound care and supportive measures. However, he has now developed worsening respiratory distress, refractory hypoxemia, and an increased oxygen requirement. Physical examination is notable for extensive burn injuries, and the infant appears agitated. Despite aggressive pulmonary interventions, including mechanical ventilation and surfactant therapy, the respiratory failure persists. The presence of severe burns complicates the diagnostic process, and a comprehensive assessment is warranted to identify the underlying reversible cause and optimize the management of the infant's respiratory and cardiac insufficiency."
