  "Pediatric brain tumors_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 9-year-old male patient, with no significant medical history, presented with a three-month history of increasingly frequent and severe headaches, which he describes as a 7/10 on the pain scale. These headaches are associated with a feeling of increased pressure in his head. The parents also reported an abrupt onset of vision problems, including double vision. The patient has been experiencing unexplained nausea and episodes of vomiting. Neurological examination revealed abnormal eye movements, and the child has shown irritability and memory problems. Given the constellation of symptoms and the abrupt onset of vision issues, further evaluation is crucial to determine the type, size, and location of a possible brain tumor and guide appropriate diagnostic and treatment strategies.",
  "Pediatric brain tumors_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 2-year-old female patient was brought in by her parents, who expressed concerns about a fuller soft spot on her skull, which they noticed over the past month. The child has been experiencing episodes of unexplained vomiting and a loss of appetite, making feeding a challenge. There is a history of delayed developmental milestones. The parents also observed abnormal eye movements and intermittent episodes of slurred speech in the child. Physical examination revealed weakness and drooping on one side of her face. Given the age of the patient, the presence of a fuller soft spot, and the combination of neurological symptoms, an evaluation for a pediatric brain tumor is imperative, taking into account the possibility of genetic syndromes in the family history.",
  "Pediatric brain tumors_3": "    Patient Description 3:\n    A 14-year-old male patient, with a family history of genetic syndromes, presented with a complex set of symptoms. He reported frequent and severe headaches, which he rated as 8/10 in intensity, along with an ongoing feeling of increased pressure in his head. The headaches have been accompanied by an abrupt onset of seizures, without any previous history. The patient has also experienced slurred speech, weakness in his right arm, and trouble walking. His academic performance has declined, and he is struggling with memory problems. Neurological examination revealed weakness and loss of sensation in the right arm and leg. Given the family history and the severity of the symptoms, an urgent assessment is necessary to identify the type, size, and location of a potential brain tumor and establish an appropriate management plan."
