  "Spontaneous coronary artery dissection_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 36-year-old female patient, who is a regular hormone contraceptive user, presented with recurrent episodes of severe chest pain, which she described as 8/10 in intensity, often accompanied by a rapid heartbeat and sweating. She reported persistent pain in her left arm and jaw, along with episodes of unusual, extreme tiredness and dizziness. The patient has no history of cardiovascular disease, but her symptoms are notably exacerbated during the postpartum period, as she has experienced two childbirths in the last five years. Given her demographic and clinical profile, the possibility of spontaneous coronary artery dissection is a significant concern in this case.",
  "Spontaneous coronary artery dissection_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 42-year-old woman with a known history of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and very high blood pressure presented with a complex set of symptoms. She reported intermittent chest pain, rated at 6/10 in severity, often associated with a fluttery feeling in her chest and sweating. The pain frequently radiated to her back and shoulders, and she experienced episodes of nausea and dizziness. The patient's medical history of FMD and hypertension, along with the atypical nature of her chest pain, raises a strong suspicion for spontaneous coronary artery dissection in this case.",
  "Spontaneous coronary artery dissection_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 40-year-old female patient, who has a family history of inherited connective tissue disease, presented with a sudden onset of severe chest pain, which she described as 9/10 in intensity, along with shortness of breath and an unusual, extreme tiredness. She reported recurrent episodes of chest pain, often accompanied by sweating and a rapid heartbeat. The pain also radiated to her arms and jaw. The patient has no history of cardiovascular disease, but her family history and the nature of her symptoms raise concerns about spontaneous coronary artery dissection, particularly given the inherited connective tissue disease in her family background."
