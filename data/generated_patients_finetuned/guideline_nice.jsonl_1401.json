  "Brain tumours_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 45-year-old male patient, with no significant medical history of note, presented with a persistent bifrontal headache, which he described as throbbing and rated 6/10 in severity. In the past few weeks, he has also experienced episodes of vomiting, particularly in the morning, without any identified gastrointestinal cause. Furthermore, the patient reported a gradual onset of limb weakness, predominantly in his left arm, and a subtle speech disturbance characterized by occasional word-finding difficulties. On examination, reduced consciousness was noted, and the patient appeared drowsy with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 14. These symptoms, in conjunction with the contextual factors, necessitate a comprehensive diagnostic workup to evaluate the location, size, and grade of the suspected brain tumour.",
  "Brain tumours_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 32-year-old female patient, known for her previous history of astrocytoma (Grade II), presented with recurrent headaches localized to the occipital region, which she described as a constant, dull ache with an intensity of 5/10. The headaches were often associated with episodes of vomiting, and the patient reported a new-onset speech disturbance, characterized by slurred speech and difficulty in articulation. Additionally, she noticed a progressive limb weakness, predominantly affecting her right leg. On examination, signs of raised intracranial pressure, including papilledema, were observed. Given the patient's history and the recurrence of symptoms, an urgent evaluation is indicated to assess the underlying tumour's location, size, and potential change in grade.",
  "Brain tumours_3": "    Patient Description 3:\n    A 50-year-old male patient, with a known history of meningioma, presented with a severe, constant headache localized to the parietal region, which he rated 8/10 in intensity. The headache was accompanied by persistent vomiting and a new-onset speech disturbance, manifested as difficulty in finding the right words and occasional slurring. The patient also reported episodes of limb weakness, more pronounced in his right arm. Neurological examination revealed reduced consciousness, with a GCS score of 12. Given the patient's history and the evolution of his symptoms, an urgent diagnostic assessment is imperative to determine the status of the known meningioma, including its location and any associated complications."
