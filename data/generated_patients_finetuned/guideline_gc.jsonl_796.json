  "Vestibular Schwannoma Surgery_1": "    Patient A, a 45-year-old, reports a persistent, deep-seated headache localized behind the right ear, with a throbbing intensity rated at 6/10 on the pain scale. The ache is frequently accompanied by episodes of dizziness and a feeling of fullness in the right ear. Notably, the patient's medical history is significant for recurrent balance problems and progressive hearing loss in the right ear over the past year, for which conservative management, including vestibular rehabilitation, yielded minimal improvement. Given the constellation of symptoms, further evaluation, including Intraoperative Facial Nerve Monitoring and Intraoperative Eighth Cranial Nerve Monitoring, is crucial to determine the underlying etiology and guide appropriate intervention.",
  "Vestibular Schwannoma Surgery_2": "    Patient B, a 55-year-old individual, presents with a complex clinical picture. The patient describes intermittent, sharp facial pain on the left side, radiating from the region near the ear to the jaw, with paroxysms reaching 7/10 in intensity. These neuralgic episodes coincide with periods of vertigo and an unsettling sensation of imbalance. Additionally, there is a documented history of progressive hearing impairment in the left ear, which has not responded to prior medical treatments such as corticosteroids. The comprehensive assessment of this patient's symptoms, coupled with the pertinent contextual information, necessitates a thorough diagnostic approach, incorporating Intraoperative Facial Nerve Monitoring and Intraoperative Eighth Cranial Nerve Monitoring, to elucidate the underlying pathology.",
  "Vestibular Schwannoma Surgery_3": "    Patient C, a 50-year-old, reports a chronically bothersome sensation of fullness and pressure deep within the left ear, often accompanied by a dull, persistent headache localized to the same side, with an average pain score of 5/10. The patient's history is notable for recurrent episodes of dizziness, which have increased in frequency and duration over the past six months. Furthermore, there is a documented decline in hearing acuity in the left ear, despite previous trials of oral and intratympanic steroids. Given these evolving symptoms and the contextual factors, including Intraoperative Facial Nerve Monitoring and Intraoperative Eighth Cranial Nerve Monitoring, a comprehensive assessment is imperative to determine the nature of the underlying condition and guide the most appropriate management strategy."
