  "Broken Leg_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 45-year-old male presented with an acute, severe pain in his right lower limb, which he described as 8/10 on the pain scale and worsens with any movement. The affected leg exhibited noticeable swelling, tenderness upon palpation, and extensive bruising. Physical examination also revealed an obvious deformity and shortening of the right leg. The patient reported a history of trauma following a fall from a height. These clinical findings, coupled with the mechanism of injury, raise strong suspicions of a significant musculoskeletal issue, necessitating urgent diagnostic evaluation and intervention.",
  "Broken Leg_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 20-year-old female sought medical attention for a concerning musculoskeletal issue. She reported severe pain in her left leg, which she rated as 9/10 and noted that it intensifies with any movement. The affected limb showed marked swelling, and the patient exhibited localized tenderness and bruising over the injured area. Importantly, she recounted a recent motor vehicle accident, which is believed to be the primary cause of her symptoms. Given the nature of the trauma, the clinical presentation, and the patient's young age, there is a high index of suspicion for a specific musculoskeletal injury, necessitating prompt diagnostic assessment and management.",
  "Broken Leg_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 3-year-old toddler was brought in by his parents due to an inability to bear weight on his right leg. The child, who had been previously healthy, was observed to limp and adamantly refused to walk. His parents reported a recent history of a minor fall at home. Physical examination revealed localized swelling, tenderness, and reluctance of the child to bear weight on the affected limb. No obvious deformity was noted, but the combination of symptoms, along with the history of the injury, raises concerns regarding a potential musculoskeletal issue. Moreover, the delayed presentation to medical care adds another layer of complexity to the diagnostic process in this young patient. Further evaluation is warranted to clarify the nature and extent of the injury and to establish an appropriate course of action."
