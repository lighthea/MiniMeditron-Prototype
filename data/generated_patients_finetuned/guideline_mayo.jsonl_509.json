  "Hydrocele_1": "    Patient A, a 45-year-old male, presents with a persistent painless swelling in the right testicle, which he first noticed six months ago. He describes a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum, particularly towards the end of the day, and has rated his pain level as 3/10, which worsens as the swelling increases. The swelling in the scrotum fluctuates, being smaller in the morning and progressively enlarging throughout the day. Notably, the patient has no history of trauma to the scrotal area. Physical examination reveals a palpable, fluid-filled mass within the right hemiscrotum. Given the presence of the described symptoms and the contextual information, differential diagnosis must consider conditions such as inguinal hernia or testicular torsion.",
  "Hydrocele_2": "    Patient B, a 30-year-old male, reports a painless enlargement of both testicles, which he has observed for the past eight months. He frequently experiences a sense of heaviness in the scrotum and has noted that his discomfort and pain level, rated at 2/10, tend to worsen as the day progresses and the swelling increases. The bilateral swelling in the scrotum follows a pattern of being smaller in the morning and progressively enlarging later in the day. There is no history of scrotal trauma or systemic illnesses. On examination, symmetrical, fluid-filled masses are palpable in both hemiscrota. Given the presenting symptoms and the contextual information, diagnostic considerations should encompass conditions such as inguinal hernia or other etiologies of scrotal swelling.",
  "Hydrocele_3": "    Patient C, a 50-year-old male, presents with a painless, persistent swelling in the left testicle that has been ongoing for the past year. He describes a constant feeling of heaviness in the affected scrotum and has rated his pain level as 4/10, which worsens as the swelling increases. The left scrotal swelling remains consistent throughout the day and is not accompanied by any history of trauma or systemic illness. Physical examination reveals a palpable, fluid-filled mass within the left hemiscrotum. In this case, the patient's symptoms and the presence of the left-sided hydrocele raise concerns for this condition. However, given the contextual information, a comprehensive differential diagnosis is necessary to rule out other causes of scrotal swelling, such as inguinal hernia or testicular torsion."
