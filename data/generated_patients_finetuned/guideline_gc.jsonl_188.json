  "Malignant Colorectal Polyps_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 55-year-old male, with a family history of colorectal issues, presented with recurrent episodes of rectal bleeding over the past six months. The bleeding is typically moderate, with a pain score of 3 on a scale of 10. He also reports a gradual but persistent change in bowel habits, experiencing increased frequency of loose stools, and has noted a sensation of incomplete evacuation. Colonoscopy revealed a large, sessile polyp with a depressed area in the rectum. Histologic examination indicated poor tumor differentiation and deep submucosal invasion exceeding 1 mm. Given the NICE classification type 3 findings and the presence of several key factors, further diagnostic workup and treatment planning are imperative.",
  "Malignant Colorectal Polyps_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 60-year-old female patient, without prior colorectal history, presented with chronic abdominal pain and discomfort, localized to the left lower quadrant, which she rated at 5 out of 10 in severity. She also reported a noticeable change in her bowel habits, with increasing constipation and a feeling of rectal fullness. During a diagnostic colonoscopy, a large polyp with a sessile shape and a dominant nodular area was identified in the sigmoid colon. Biopsy results revealed lymphovascular invasion and poor tumor differentiation. The presence of Kudo classification type V and additional diagnostic factors necessitates a comprehensive evaluation to determine the extent of the condition and plan an appropriate course of action.",
  "Malignant Colorectal Polyps_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 50-year-old male patient, with a history of benign colorectal polyps, presented with recurrent sharp abdominal pains, frequently reaching a level of 7 out of 10 in intensity. He described these pains as crampy and associated with bloating. Additionally, he reported unexplained weight loss of 10 pounds over the last three months. A surveillance colonoscopy identified a protruding polyp with an irregular surface and documented tumor involvement of the cautery margin. Histological analysis revealed tumor budding and a high-grade of differentiation. The patient's symptoms, coupled with the findings of LST-NG morphology and involved margins, underscore the need for an in-depth diagnostic assessment and a tailored management approach."
