  "Bile reflux_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 47-year-old male, with a history of gallbladder surgery five years ago, presented with distressing upper abdominal pain rated at 7/10, frequently accompanied by heartburn. The pain is often associated with a sour taste in his mouth. Despite using over-the-counter antacids, he experiences episodes of nausea and has vomited greenish-yellow fluid on several occasions. The patient has noticed a persistent cough and hoarseness. Additionally, he has unintentionally lost 10 pounds over the last three months. The constellation of symptoms, in the context of his prior gallbladder surgery, raises concerns about bile reflux.",
  "Bile reflux_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 55-year-old female, with a history of gastric reflux disease (GERD), presented with recurrent upper abdominal pain, rated at 6/10, and frequent heartburn. She often experiences a sour taste in her mouth, and her symptoms have become more pronounced over the last three months. Despite being on proton pump inhibitors, the patient reports episodes of nausea and has vomited greenish-yellow fluid. She also complains of a persistent cough and intermittent hoarseness. The presence of ongoing symptoms, despite treatment for GERD, is concerning, and the possibility of bile reflux needs to be thoroughly evaluated.",
  "Bile reflux_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 60-year-old male, who underwent stomach surgery two years ago for peptic ulcers, reported persistent upper abdominal pain, rated at 8/10, along with frequent heartburn and a sour taste in his mouth. Despite a history of peptic ulcers, his current symptoms are not typical of his previous condition. In the last six months, the patient has experienced nausea and recurrent episodes of vomiting greenish-yellow fluid. He has also noticed an unintentional weight loss of 15 pounds. The atypical nature of his symptoms, along with the history of stomach surgery, necessitates a comprehensive assessment to ascertain the presence of bile reflux."
