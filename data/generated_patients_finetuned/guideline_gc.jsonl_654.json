  "Acne Vulgaris_1": "    Description 1:\n    A 25-year-old female patient, with a history of irregular menstruation and hirsutism, presented with a persistent skin condition. She described the presence of multiple acne-like lesions, consisting of both comedonal and inflammatory acne, predominantly affecting her face and upper back. Notably, the patient reported additional signs of androgen excess, including increased facial hair growth. Despite adhering to a skincare routine and dietary modifications, the acne lesions have persisted. The patient's distress regarding her appearance and the social impact of her skin condition is notable. The diagnostic process should consider the documented androgen-related symptoms, as well as the potential influence of her high glycemic index diet and consumption of skim milk.",
  "Acne Vulgaris_2": "    Description 2:\n    A 20-year-old male patient, without prior significant medical history, presented with a notable skin concern. He reported the presence of acne-like lesions, characterized by both comedonal and inflammatory acne, distributed across his face, chest, and upper arms. The patient described the persistence of these lesions despite the use of over-the-counter acne treatments. His pain level, attributed to the inflammatory acne, is rated at 5 on a scale of 0 to 10. The diagnostic assessment should encompass the clinical features of acne vulgaris, while also considering the patient's lifestyle factors, including a high glycemic index diet. ",
  "Acne Vulgaris_3": "    Description 3:\n    A 30-year-old female patient, with a history of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), presented with a chronic skin condition. She exhibited acne-like lesions, including both comedonal and inflammatory acne, mainly affecting her face and upper back. The presence of additional signs of androgen excess, such as hirsutism and irregular menstruation, was documented in the patient's medical history. Despite previous treatments for acne, the condition has persisted, leading to emotional distress and decreased self-esteem. The patient's high glycemic index diet, along with her PCOS, adds complexity to the diagnostic process, necessitating a comprehensive assessment of the factors contributing to her acne vulgaris."
