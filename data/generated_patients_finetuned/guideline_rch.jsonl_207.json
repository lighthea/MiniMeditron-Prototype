  "Blocked tube_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 45-year-old female with a history of dysphagia and dependence on a gastrostomy tube for enteral feeding presents with recurrent episodes of blockage in the tube. She describes her symptoms as a feeling of fullness and pressure around the insertion site, accompanied by a persistent, cramp-like abdominal discomfort rated at 6/10 on the pain scale. Despite regular tube flushing, the blockages have become increasingly frequent. The patient's medication history reveals that she has been inconsistently crushing her medications, which may contribute to the blockage. A comprehensive evaluation is warranted to identify the underlying cause and implement effective management strategies.",
  "Blocked tube_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 60-year-old male, reliant on a gastrostomy tube for nutritional support due to oropharyngeal dysphagia, presents with a recurring issue of tube blockage. He reports a sensation of resistance and localized tenderness at the tube insertion site, along with intermittent, moderate abdominal pain (4/10 on the pain scale). The patient acknowledges occasionally administering poorly crushed medications through the tube and has observed that his feeds, at times, contain lumps of powder. Proper assessment is essential to address the recurrent blockages and optimize the enteral feeding regimen while alleviating the patient's symptoms.",
  "Blocked tube_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 55-year-old male with a history of neurologic impairment leading to swallowing difficulties has experienced persistent blockages in his gastrostomy tube. He describes the sensation as a frequent \"clogging\" at the tube site, accompanied by mild, crampy abdominal pain rated at 3/10 in intensity. Despite regular tube flushing, the blockages persist. The patient's caregiver admits to occasionally introducing vitamised food into the tube, which may be contributing to the issue. A comprehensive diagnostic assessment is necessary to determine the cause of the blockages and optimize the patient's enteral feeding management."
