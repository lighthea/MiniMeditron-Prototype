  "Measles in Healthcare Settings_1": " 1.    A 32-year-old female healthcare worker presents with a 3-day history of fever, cough, and runny nose. The fever has been persistent, with temperatures ranging between 101-103\u00b0F, and the cough is described as dry and moderately severe, causing noticeable chest discomfort. She reports a mild to moderate conjunctivitis in both eyes, accompanied by a diffuse rash that started on her face and has progressively spread to her trunk and limbs. Upon oral examination, characteristic Koplik spots are observed in the oral cavity. The patient's medical history indicates no prior documented measles vaccination, and she has not had any recent measles exposure. Given the nature of her symptoms and her occupation as a healthcare worker, measles should be considered as a differential diagnosis, necessitating further evaluation and appropriate precautions.",
