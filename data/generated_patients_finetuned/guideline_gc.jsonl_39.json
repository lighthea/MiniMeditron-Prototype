  "Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer without Driver Alterations_1": "Patient A, a 61-year-old male with a 40 pack-year smoking history, presents with a concerning constellation of symptoms. He reports persistent cough, hemoptysis, and increasing dyspnea, which he describes as 6/10 in severity and has notably impacted his daily activities. The cough has been ongoing for the past 4 months, and he has experienced unintentional weight loss of 15 pounds within the same duration. Notably, his performance status (PS) has declined, currently rated at 2. Despite prior courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics and inhaled bronchodilators, his respiratory symptoms persist. Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds in the right lower lobe. Given the clinical presentation and the significant impact on the patient's PS, further diagnostic evaluation is imperative to characterize the underlying pathology.",
  "Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer without Driver Alterations_2": "Patient B, a 58-year-old former heavy smoker with a 30 pack-year history, seeks medical attention for a constellation of distressing symptoms. He reports a chronic, debilitating cough, which he rates at 7/10 in intensity, often accompanied by hemoptysis. The cough has been ongoing for 6 months and is associated with pronounced dyspnea, rated at 8/10, severely limiting his functional capacity. Additionally, the patient has experienced a profound unintentional weight loss of 20 pounds over the same period. His performance status (PS) has declined to 3, further impeding his daily activities. Despite a trial of bronchodilators and corticosteroids, his symptoms persist unabated. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds in the right upper lung. Given the severity of the symptoms and the substantial impact on the patient's PS, an urgent diagnostic workup is warranted to elucidate the underlying etiology of his condition.",
  "Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer without Driver Alterations_3": "Patient C, a 63-year-old female, presents with a complex array of symptoms. She reports a chronic, bothersome cough, which she rates at 5/10 in severity, and has been present for the past 8 months. The cough is often accompanied by episodes of hemoptysis. She also describes a gradual onset of dyspnea, which she currently rates at 5/10 and has led to a discernible decline in her performance status (PS), now rated at 2. Additionally, the patient has experienced an unintended weight loss of 12 pounds within the last 6 months. Despite multiple courses of antibiotics and inhaled bronchodilators, her respiratory symptoms persist. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds in the left lower lung field. Given the prolonged and impactful nature of her symptoms, further diagnostic assessment is crucial to determine the nature of her condition."
