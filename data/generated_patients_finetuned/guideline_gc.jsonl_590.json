  "Anticoagulation in Adult Patients Supported with Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 45-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and previous anticoagulant therapy was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and was placed on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. Despite being on therapeutic anticoagulation, the patient developed significant circuit clotting issues, requiring multiple interventions for clot removal. Additionally, he presented with new-onset hemoptysis, and imaging studies revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities in the lungs. The patient's pain level is consistently rated at 5/10, localized to the chest, and is exacerbated during coughing. Coagulation studies show a subtherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) despite aggressive anticoagulation. The challenges in maintaining adequate anticoagulation therapy in this setting have posed a clinical dilemma.",
  "Anticoagulation in Adult Patients Supported with Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 60-year-old female, known for her medical history of deep vein thrombosis, was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome and was initiated on veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support following a pulmonary embolism. During her ICU stay, the patient developed a diffuse petechial rash on her lower extremities, which was non-blanching and associated with severe pain, rated at 8/10. The rash was not responsive to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) panel, and her platelet counts remained within the normal range. Despite therapeutic anticoagulation, she experienced recurrent episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding, with a documented drop in hemoglobin levels. The challenge of managing the patient's anticoagulation, coupled with the atypical rash and gastrointestinal bleeding, has complicated her clinical course.",
  "Anticoagulation in Adult Patients Supported with Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 50-year-old male, with no significant past medical history, was admitted to the ICU for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome of unclear etiology and was placed on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. Despite being on therapeutic anticoagulation, the patient developed acute, severe abdominal pain, localized to the epigastric region, which he rated at 9/10. The pain was associated with distention and tenderness on palpation. Imaging studies revealed a new-onset large intraperitoneal hematoma, which was concerning for hemorrhagic complications. The patient's coagulation parameters were within the therapeutic range, and there was no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. The challenge of managing the patient's anticoagulation to prevent circuit clotting while addressing the acute abdominal hemorrhage has become a critical concern in his care."
