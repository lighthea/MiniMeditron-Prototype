  "Forearm injuries_1": "    Patient A, a 9-year-old male, presents with a moderately anguishing left forearm injury. The injury occurred following a fall from a playground apparatus. Physical examination reveals tenderness, swelling, and deformity over the midshaft of the ulna. The child is cooperative but reports a pain level of 7 on a scale of 10. Limb neurovascular observations have been documented and are within normal limits. Given the nature of the injury, there is a requirement for forearm manipulation to address the fracture. It is crucial to note that the clinician performing this procedure should have prior experience, and supervision is recommended, as outlined in the contextual information.",
  "Forearm injuries_2": "    Patient B, a 6-year-old female, is brought to the emergency department with a forearm injury. The child sustained a laceration to her right forearm while playing outdoors. The laceration is approximately 3 cm in length and is actively bleeding. The patient's pain level is rated at 6 on a scale of 10. A thorough examination reveals a need for laceration repair. The clinician attending to the patient intends to perform the necessary procedure, but it is essential to adhere to the recommended guidelines, especially regarding the documentation of limb neurovascular observations and the ability to provide resuscitation in the event of local anesthetic poisoning, as highlighted in the contextual information.",
  "Forearm injuries_3": "    Patient C, a 7-year-old male, is brought in with a forearm injury. The child's medical history is significant for a previous forearm fracture, which was managed conservatively. He now presents with a recurrent injury to the same forearm, following a minor fall. On examination, there is tenderness and localized swelling around the site of the previous fracture. The patient reports a pain level of 5 on a scale of 10. While limb neurovascular observations are normal, the nature of the injury necessitates a careful assessment before any manipulation is performed. Given the patient's history, the clinician must consider the implications of the recurrent injury and exercise caution during the evaluation and management process, in accordance with the provided contextual information.\n"
