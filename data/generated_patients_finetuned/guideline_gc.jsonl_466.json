  "Rhinosinusitis_1": "    Patient A, a 35-year-old individual, presents with a one-week history of purulent nasal discharge, facial pain localized over the affected sinus area, and pressure sensation in the maxillary region. The pain, rated at 6/10 in intensity, is exacerbated when bending forward. The duration of symptoms and the presence of purulent nasal discharge are consistent with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ARS). The patient has no known predisposing factors, and this episode is not a recurrence of a prior sinus issue. Notably, there is no history of recent upper respiratory tract infections or relevant environmental exposures.",
  "Rhinosinusitis_2": "    Patient B, a 50-year-old individual, has been experiencing recurrent episodes of nasal congestion, facial pain, and pressure over the frontal and maxillary sinuses for the past three months. The facial pain, which the patient describes as a dull ache with an intensity of 4/10, is a constant presence and is associated with a reduced sense of smell. These chronic symptoms align with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP). Patient B has a history of seasonal allergies but reports minimal relief from antihistamines and nasal steroid sprays, which were previously attempted as a therapeutic intervention.",
  "Rhinosinusitis_3": "    Patient C, a 40-year-old individual, presents with a protracted history of nasal congestion, hyposmia, and bilateral nasal polyposis. The patient describes the nasal obstruction as persistent and severe, impacting both breathing and olfaction. Facial pain is intermittently sharp, with an intensity reaching 7/10 during acute episodes. Endoscopic examination reveals the presence of nasal polyps. These findings are consistent with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Patient C reports a decade-long history of nasal polyps, which have been managed with oral corticosteroids and nasal sprays, providing only temporary relief. There is no history of aspirin sensitivity or asthma."
