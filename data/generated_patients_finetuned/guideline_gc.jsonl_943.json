  "COVID-19_1": "    **Patient Description 1:**\n    A 45-year-old male, with a history of hypertension, presented with a persistent dry cough (rated 4/10 for discomfort) and gradually increasing shortness of breath over the past week, accompanied by a low-grade fever. Notably, the patient's occupation necessitates frequent interactions with the public. On examination, diminished breath sounds were observed in the lower lung fields. The patient's hospitalization status is currently stable, but given the nature of his work, there is an elevated risk of disease progression. Diagnostic evaluation is imperative to determine the severity of illness and guide appropriate management.",
  "COVID-19_2": "    **Patient Description 2:**\n    A 30-year-old female patient, with no significant medical history, reported a sudden onset of fever, which she described as 7/10 in intensity, associated with fatigue and myalgias. The fever has persisted for four days and is unresponsive to over-the-counter antipyretics. The patient also developed an anosmia and ageusia. She works in a long-term care facility with known COVID-19 cases. Although currently not hospitalized, the risk of disease progression in this setting is notable. The diagnostic assessment is crucial to gauge the severity of illness and initiate timely interventions.",
  "COVID-19_3": "    **Patient Description 3:**\n    An 55-year-old male, ex-smoker, presented to the emergency department with acute-onset chest pain (rated 6/10) on inspiration and during coughing. The pain is accompanied by a productive cough, which has recently become more frequent. The patient has a low-grade fever and a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). His occupation involves regular exposure to industrial fumes. The patient's hospitalization status is currently stable. Given the underlying COPD and occupational exposure, there is an increased risk of disease progression. The severity of illness needs to be promptly assessed to guide appropriate management in the context of his pre-existing lung condition."
