  "Non-complex fractures_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 45-year-old male presented with a localized, intense pain in his right forearm, which he rated at 7/10 on the pain scale. The pain was exacerbated with any movement and was associated with limited mobility in the affected arm. Significant swelling, evident deformity, and bruising were also noted in the region. The patient has a history of participating in high-impact sports activities. These symptoms are consistent with a non-complex fracture, and the patient's age and active lifestyle may influence the diagnostic and treatment approach.",
  "Non-complex fractures_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 13-year-old adolescent female was brought to the clinic with complaints of persistent pain in her left lower leg, rated at 6/10 in intensity. The pain had led to a notable limitation in her mobility, especially during weight-bearing activities. Physical examination revealed localized swelling, as well as mild deformity and bruising in the affected area. Given the patient's developmental stage and the presence of growth plates, a non-complex fracture is highly suspected. These factors, along with her cognitive function, will be crucial in determining the most appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",
  "Non-complex fractures_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 60-year-old male with a history of osteoporosis presented with an acute onset of severe, throbbing pain in his right hip, which he described as 9/10 in intensity. The pain was associated with a complete inability to bear weight on the affected hip. Clinically, there was pronounced swelling, deformity, and extensive bruising in the hip region. These findings are indicative of a non-complex fracture, and the patient's age, along with his medical history of osteoporosis, significantly influences the diagnostic and management considerations in this case."
