  "Hypoxic Ischaemic Encephalopathy (HIE)_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A term newborn, weighing 3.5 kg, with an Apgar score of 5 at 5 minutes, was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) due to marked encephalopathy and a history of an acute perinatal event. The infant exhibits cellular hypoxia, as evidenced by moderate to severely abnormal background activity on the EEG, along with increased seizure activity. Additionally, there are signs of raised intracranial pressure. The presence of cytotoxic edema and subcutaneous fat necrosis further supports the clinical presentation. Given the gestational age, birth weight, Apgar score, and the observed symptoms, there is a high index of suspicion for hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE). The patient's condition necessitates urgent monitoring and intervention.",
  "Hypoxic Ischaemic Encephalopathy (HIE)_2": "Patient Description 2:\n    A full-term neonate, weighing 2.8 kg, was delivered with a cord pH of 7.1 and a base deficit of 12 mmol/L. The infant is presenting with sinus bradycardia, seizures, and signs of increased intracranial pressure. Notably, the amplitude-integrated EEG shows a marked and persistently abnormal background activity. The clinical picture is indicative of mitochondrial failure and the accumulation of excitotoxins, contributing to the observed encephalopathy and seizure activity. The presence of these symptoms, along with the acidosis at birth, raises strong concerns for hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE). Given the contextual factors and the severity of the infant's condition, prompt and comprehensive management is imperative.",
  "Hypoxic Ischaemic Encephalopathy (HIE)_3": "Patient Description 3:\n    A 36-week preterm neonate, weighing 2.2 kg, was born with an Apgar score of 3 at 1 minute, which improved to 7 at 5 minutes. The arterial pH at birth was 7.15, with a base excess of -10 mmol/L. The infant is now exhibiting cellular hypoxia, as evidenced by active cell death and increased seizure activity. The EEG shows moderately abnormal background activity. Additionally, there are clinical signs of raised intracranial pressure and subcutaneous fat necrosis. Given the gestational age, birth weight, Apgar scores, and the observed symptoms, the diagnosis of hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) is highly pertinent. The patient's complex clinical profile necessitates a multi-disciplinary approach to management, considering the prematurity and the presence of moderate to severe HIE."
