  "Newly Diagnosed, Advanced Ovarian Cancer_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 58-year-old woman, with a history of chronic pelvic pain and bloating for the past six months, presented with persistent abdominal distention and increasing discomfort, rated at 7/10 in intensity. She has experienced unintentional weight loss of 10 pounds over the last three months. Diagnostic evaluation revealed stage IIIC invasive epithelial ovarian cancer. Given her perioperative risk profile and histologic confirmation, the patient's diagnostic and treatment journey will necessitate careful consideration of her overall medical fitness and the likelihood of achieving optimal cytoreduction.",
  "Newly Diagnosed, Advanced Ovarian Cancer_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 64-year-old woman, with a background of intermittent abdominal discomfort, reported a recent exacerbation of her symptoms. She described a persistent sensation of abdominal fullness and bloating, coupled with new-onset pelvic pain, scoring at 6/10 in intensity. Imaging studies identified stage IV invasive epithelial ovarian cancer. The patient's diagnostic and treatment course should take into account her response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) or the stability of the disease, along with the comprehensive assessment of her fitness for primary cytoreductive surgery and the management of any progressive disease.",
  "Newly Diagnosed, Advanced Ovarian Cancer_3": "    Patient Description 3:\n    A 52-year-old woman presented with a three-month history of abdominal pain, which she rated at 8/10 in severity, along with a rapidly enlarging abdominal mass. The patient has experienced significant fatigue and a notable unintentional weight loss of 15 pounds within the last two months. Diagnostic workup confirmed stage IV invasive epithelial ovarian cancer. Given the advanced disease stage and the patient's symptoms, the comprehensive assessment should address her perioperative risk profile, the histologic confirmation, and the management of any progressive disease, all of which will be crucial in guiding her treatment plan."
