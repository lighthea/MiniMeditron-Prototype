  "Corns and Calluses_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 46-year-old male patient, with a history of type 2 diabetes, presented with a thick, rough area of skin on the plantar aspect of his right foot. The lesion has developed into a hardened, raised bump, measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter. The patient reported tenderness and intermittent pain, which he rated as 4/10 in severity, localized to the site of the lesion. He described the skin over the bump as flaky and dry. Despite regular monitoring of his blood glucose levels, the lesion has persisted for the past two months. The patient's choice of footwear is appropriate, and there is no evidence of poor blood flow in the affected extremity. Physical examination revealed the presence of a corn with a central core, consistent with the patient's symptoms and medical history.",
  "Corns and Calluses_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 35-year-old female patient, without any significant medical history, presented with a painful, raised bump on the dorsal aspect of her left hand. The lesion was approximately 0.5 cm in diameter and was covered with flaky, dry skin. The patient reported tenderness and a constant, dull pain, which she rated as 6/10 in severity, localized to the site of the bump. She attributed the development of the bump to the frequent use of hand tools in her occupation as a carpenter. The patient has been applying over-the-counter corn pads without relief. Her choice of hand tools and equipment is appropriate, and there is no family history of corns or calluses. Physical examination confirmed the presence of a corn with a hardened, raised bump consistent with the patient's symptoms and occupational history.",
  "Corns and Calluses_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 60-year-old male patient, with a history of peripheral vascular disease, presented with a tender, thickened area of skin on the lateral aspect of his right foot. The lesion, measuring 0.8 cm in diameter, appeared as a hardened, raised bump with flaky, waxy skin. The patient reported intermittent pain, which he rated as 5/10 in severity, localized to the site of the bump. He attributed the development of the lesion to the pressure from his ill-fitting shoes, which he had been wearing for the past six months. Despite conservative measures, including footwear modification, the lesion persisted. The patient's peripheral vascular disease is stable and managed with medications. Physical examination revealed a corn with a central core, consistent with the patient's symptoms and medical history."
