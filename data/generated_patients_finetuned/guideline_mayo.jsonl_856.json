  "Reactive arthritis_1": "Doctor's Description 1:\nA 30-year-old male patient presented with a complex set of symptoms, including persistent joint pain and stiffness in the knees, ankles, and low back, rated at 6/10 on the pain scale. He also reported inflammation in the eyes, coupled with increased frequency and discomfort during urination. The onset of these manifestations occurred approximately 3 weeks after a documented gastrointestinal infection. Additionally, the patient exhibited swollen toes and a rash on the soles of his feet and palms of his hands. Given the temporal relationship between the triggering infection and the development of these symptoms, along with the pattern of joint involvement and associated urogenital issues, a comprehensive evaluation is warranted to determine the underlying etiology and guide appropriate management.",
  "Reactive arthritis_2": "Doctor's Description 2:\nA 28-year-old female patient with a history of recent genitourinary infection presented with a constellation of symptoms suggestive of a rheumatologic condition. She reported persistent joint pain and stiffness, prominently affecting her heels, buttocks, and low back, with a pain intensity rating of 7/10. Furthermore, the patient experienced eye inflammation (conjunctivitis) and noted an increased frequency and discomfort during urination. Physical examination revealed signs of enthesitis and swollen fingers. The temporal association between the preceding genital infection and the onset of these symptoms, along with the characteristic pattern of joint involvement, warrants a thorough diagnostic workup to elucidate the underlying pathology and formulate an optimal treatment plan.",
  "Reactive arthritis_3": "Doctor's Description 3:\nA 35-year-old male patient, following a recent episode of gastrointestinal illness, presented with a complex clinical picture indicative of a systemic inflammatory condition. He reported significant joint pain and stiffness in the ankles, feet, and low back, with a pain intensity of 8/10, along with eye inflammation and discomfort during urination. The presence of enthesitis, swollen toes, and skin problems, including mouth sores and rash on the soles of his feet and palms of his hands, added further complexity to the case. Given the temporal relationship between the triggering infection and the onset of these multi-faceted symptoms, an in-depth diagnostic assessment is crucial to determine the specific etiology and devise an effective therapeutic approach."
