  "Patent foramen ovale_1": "    Description 1:\n    A 58-year-old male patient, with a history of recurrent strokes, presents with concerning symptoms. He describes intermittent episodes of transient visual disturbances, weakness, and numbness in the left side of his body, indicative of a transient ischaemic attack (TIA). These episodes are often accompanied by a headache, with a pain level of 4/10. The patient's medical history is significant for an increased risk of blood clots, and further evaluation is warranted to determine the underlying etiology of his paradoxical embolism. Given the presence of a thromboembolic event, a comprehensive assessment is crucial for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.",
  "Patent foramen ovale_2": "    Description 2:\n    A 45-year-old female patient, who leads a sedentary lifestyle, presents with a complex medical history. She reports a recent episode of stroke, characterized by sudden-onset weakness on the right side of her body and difficulty speaking. The intensity of her post-stroke pain is rated at 6/10. Considering her history, there is a heightened concern for a paradoxical embolism related to a patent foramen ovale. The patient's lifestyle and the documented stroke necessitate a thorough diagnostic workup to assess the extent of the condition and guide treatment decisions.",
  "Patent foramen ovale_3": "    Description 3:\n    In the cardiology clinic, a 50-year-old male patient seeks evaluation for an increased risk of blood clots, which has previously led to a pulmonary embolism. He is now experiencing recurrent episodes of chest pain and dyspnoea, with a reported pain level of 5/10 during these episodes. Given the patient's history and the presence of a thromboembolic event, there is a concern for paradoxical embolism associated with a patent foramen ovale. It is imperative to assess the extent of this condition, as it may be contributing to the recurrent embolic events and guide the management of his cardiovascular health."
