  "Complicated grief_1": "    Case 1:\n    A 45-year-old woman, with no significant past medical history, presented with a complex array of symptoms following the loss of her husband in a car accident 14 months ago. The patient reported intense and persistent sorrow, often rating her emotional pain as 8/10, accompanied by incessant rumination over her husband's death. She dwelled extensively on memories of her late spouse, displaying an extreme focus on reminders of him while actively avoiding situations or places that evoked his memory. Her grief has led to a pervasive sense of numbness, detachment, and a profound inability to derive enjoyment from life or recollect positive experiences with her loved one. The patient's grief has significantly disrupted her daily routines, causing social withdrawal and isolation. Additionally, she expressed feelings of guilt, self-blame, and a belief that life lacks meaning or purpose without her husband. This presentation is further complicated by the coexistence of clinical depression, making it imperative to address the patient's condition comprehensively.",
