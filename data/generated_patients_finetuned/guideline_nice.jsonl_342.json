  "Paravalvular leak_1": "Patient A, a 64-year-old male with a notable medical history of bioprosthetic valve replacement three years ago, presents with progressively worsening symptoms. He reports dyspnea on exertion (NYHA Class III) and orthopnea, consistent with decompensated heart failure. In addition, he exhibits signs of haemolytic anaemia, including fatigue and jaundice. The presence of these symptoms, coupled with the patient's history of valve replacement, raises concerns about a paravalvular leak. Notably, the diagnostic approach will be influenced by the type and severity of the leak.",
  "Paravalvular leak_2": "Patient B, a 58-year-old female, presents with a complex clinical picture. She has a history of mechanical valve replacement and is experiencing recurrent episodes of heart failure, characterized by dyspnea (NYHA Class III) and peripheral oedema. Additionally, the patient has developed haemolytic anaemia, as evidenced by fatigue and jaundice. These symptoms, in the context of her valve replacement history, raise suspicion of a paravalvular leak. The diagnostic process is further complicated by the need to assess the type of leak, adding an additional layer of complexity to the evaluation.",
  "Paravalvular leak_3": "Patient C, a 70-year-old male, presents with a challenging medical scenario. He has a history of biological valve replacement and is now manifesting symptoms indicative of heart failure, including dyspnea on exertion (NYHA Class III) and orthopnea. Furthermore, he exhibits signs of haemolytic anaemia, such as fatigue and jaundice. Given his clinical history, the presence of these symptoms raises concerns about a paravalvular leak. The diagnostic process is notably influenced by the type of leak, adding complexity to the evaluation of his condition."
