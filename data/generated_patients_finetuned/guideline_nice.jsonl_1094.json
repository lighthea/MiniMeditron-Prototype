  "Disorders of the temporomandibular joint_1": "Case 1:\nA 36-year-old female patient presented with persistent, bilateral pain in the temporomandibular joint area, rated at 6/10 on the pain scale, along with difficulty in opening and closing her mouth. The pain has been progressively worsening over the last six months and is exacerbated during chewing. The patient has also reported an inability to eat a normal diet due to this discomfort. No history of trauma or surgical procedures in the orofacial region was reported. Physical examination revealed tenderness around the temporomandibular joint and limited jaw mobility. Further evaluation is warranted to determine the underlying etiology of the patient's symptoms.",
  "Disorders of the temporomandibular joint_2": "Case 2:\nA 45-year-old male patient, with a history of inflammatory arthritis, presented with chronic bilateral temporomandibular joint pain, rated at 7/10 in intensity, accompanied by difficulty in opening and closing his mouth. The pain is exacerbated during periods of increased arthritis activity. The patient also reported an inability to eat a normal diet due to the restricted jaw mobility and discomfort. The presence of underlying inflammatory arthritis adds complexity to the diagnostic process. Physical examination revealed tenderness and swelling in the temporomandibular joint area. A comprehensive assessment is necessary to discern the specific nature of the temporomandibular joint disorder in the context of the patient's inflammatory arthritis.",
  "Disorders of the temporomandibular joint_3": "Case 3:\nA 28-year-old male patient, with a history of a previous mandibular fracture following trauma, presented with persistent, localized pain in his temporomandibular joint, rated at 5/10 in severity. The pain is accompanied by difficulty in opening and closing his mouth, particularly during the initial post-trauma period. The patient experiences discomfort while chewing and has adapted to a softer diet due to this limitation. Physical examination revealed tenderness and a history of trauma to the mandibular region. The patient's symptoms are notably linked to the preceding injury, and a comprehensive evaluation is essential to address the specific temporomandibular joint disorder in the context of his traumatic history."
