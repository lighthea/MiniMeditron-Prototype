  "Cystic Fibrosis_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 25-year-old male patient with a history of recurrent respiratory issues presented with a persistent cough, increased shortness of breath (rated 6/10 for severity), and nutritional status concerns, reflected in a BMI of 17.5. The patient has a known diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) and has been non-adherent to the prescribed treatment plan for the past year. His FEV1 is measured at 45% predicted, indicating a further decline from previous assessments. The presence of chronic cough, along with the decline in lung function, underscores the severity of the patient's respiratory condition. Additionally, the ongoing nutritional challenges and non-adherence to treatment are contributing to the overall disease burden in this individual.",
  "Cystic Fibrosis_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 30-year-old female patient, diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (CF) during childhood, presented with a complex set of symptoms. She reported persistent shortness of breath (pain level 4/10), coupled with difficulties in managing her diabetes, as indicated by uncontrolled blood glucose levels. The patient's FEV1 was measured at 36% predicted, highlighting a severe decline in lung function. Furthermore, she exhibited nutritional status issues, with a BMI of 16.7, reflecting a chronic struggle with maintaining adequate weight. Despite the use of insulin, the patient's diabetes management remains challenging, correlating with her CF-related exacerbations. This case underscores the intricate interplay between respiratory, nutritional, and endocrine manifestations of CF, necessitating a comprehensive management approach.",
  "Cystic Fibrosis_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 20-year-old male patient with a history of cystic fibrosis (CF) presented with a constellation of symptoms indicative of advanced disease. The patient reported marked shortness of breath (rated 7/10 for severity) and had a documented FEV1 of 30% predicted, signifying a significant decline in lung function. He exhibited recurrent respiratory exacerbations requiring intravenous antibiotics and positive pressure ventilation. Additionally, the patient's nutritional status was compromised, with a BMI below 18. His clinical history was notable for physical inactivity and non-adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen. The combination of severe respiratory insufficiency, nutritional challenges, and non-adherence underscores the complexity of managing CF in this young adult, necessitating a multidisciplinary approach to address his multidimensional needs."
