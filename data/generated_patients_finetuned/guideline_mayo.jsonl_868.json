  "Retinal diseases_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 55-year-old male, with a significant history of smoking and obesity, presented with a chief complaint of persistent visual disturbances. He described seeing numerous floating specks and cobwebs in his visual field, often accompanied by episodes of blurred and distorted vision. The patient reported a noticeable defect in his side vision, particularly in low light conditions. These symptoms have been ongoing for the past six months and have progressively worsened. Despite no previous ocular trauma, the patient's family history is notable for retinal diseases. His overall visual discomfort is rated at 6/10, and he has not undergone any prior ophthalmic treatments.",
  "Retinal diseases_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 40-year-old female, with a history of type 2 diabetes, presented with concerning visual symptoms. She reported a persistent sensation of seeing floating specks and cobwebs in her vision, coupled with episodes of blurred and distorted visual perception, particularly when viewing straight lines, which appeared wavy. The patient also noted defects in her side vision, predominantly in her left eye. These symptoms have been present for the last four months and have led to a noticeable decline in her overall vision, with intermittent episodes of lost vision. The patient rates her visual discomfort at 7/10. Given her medical history of diabetes, these symptoms raise significant diagnostic concerns.",
  "Retinal diseases_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 65-year-old male, without any known medical conditions, presented with a gradual onset of visual disturbances. He described persistent visual phenomena, including seeing floating specks and cobwebs, as well as blurred and distorted vision, particularly when looking at straight lines, which appeared wavy. The patient also reported defects in his side vision, more pronounced in his right eye. Over the past year, he has experienced episodes of lost vision, which have contributed to a decline in his overall visual acuity. The patient rates his visual discomfort at 5/10 and has not undergone any prior ophthalmic treatments. There is no history of ocular trauma or family retinal diseases. Given the patient's age, these symptoms warrant a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation."
