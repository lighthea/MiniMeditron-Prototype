  "Jaundice (or hyperbilirubinaemia)_1": "    Doctor's Description 1:\n    \n    A 10-day-old neonate, born at term with no significant perinatal complications, was brought in by the parents due to concerns of jaundice, which appeared within the first 24 hours of life. The infant is notably unwell and febrile, with a persistent fever. Furthermore, the presence of dark urine and pale stools is indicative of biliary obstruction. The parents have observed a significant weight loss of more than 10% within the first week of life. On examination, there is a cephalohaematoma and significant bruising. The infant also exhibits general tone abnormalities and an abnormal neurological exam. Additionally, there are signs of abnormal hydration status, including prolonged capillary refill time and tachycardia. Given the multifaceted clinical presentation and the rapid onset of jaundice, further diagnostic evaluation is imperative to determine the underlying etiology and institute appropriate management.",
  "Jaundice (or hyperbilirubinaemia)_3": "    A 3-week-old infant, born at 35 weeks of gestation with a history of intrauterine growth restriction, is presenting with jaundice that manifested within the first 24 hours of life. The parents have observed a concerning weight loss of more than 10% since birth. The infant exhibits a cephalohaematoma and bruising, raising additional clinical red flags. Furthermore, there are abnormalities in the general tone, and the neurological exam is deemed abnormal. Hepatosplenomegaly is palpable on physical examination. Given the premature birth and intrauterine growth restriction, the diagnostic approach must consider these contextual factors in conjunction with the observed symptoms to elucidate the underlying cause of the jaundice and formulate an appropriate management plan.",
  "Jaundice (or hyperbilirubinaemia)_5": "    A 14-day-old neonate, born at term without complications, presents with jaundice that became apparent within the first 24 hours of life. The infant's parents reported a notable weight loss exceeding 10% in the first week. Physical examination reveals the presence of a cephalohaematoma and bruising. The infant displays general tone abnormalities, an abnormal neurological exam, and evidence of abnormal hydration status, including delayed capillary refill time and tachycardia. Additionally, there is hepatosplenomegaly. The diagnostic process must take into account the rapid onset of jaundice, the observed weight loss, and the clinical findings to determine the underlying cause and guide the appropriate therapeutic interventions."
