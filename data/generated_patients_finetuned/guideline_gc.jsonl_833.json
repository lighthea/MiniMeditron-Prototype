  "Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 42-year-old male patient with a history of unexplained weight loss and recurrent episodes of pruritus is being evaluated for a hepatobiliary condition. The patient has been experiencing persistent pruritus, which has not responded to conservative measures, and is accompanied by rising serum CA 19-9 levels. Additionally, the patient has a history of equivocal MRI/MRCP findings, with cholangiographic features showing intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic strictures alternating with normal or slightly dilated segments. Laboratory tests have revealed persistently elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and \u03b3-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels. Given the concerns for autoimmune hepatitis overlap and the patient's new diagnosis of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), further evaluation is warranted to determine the extent of bile duct dilation and the potential presence of small-duct PSC.",
  "Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 37-year-old female patient, with a medical history significant for autoimmune disorders, has been experiencing a complex array of symptoms, raising concerns about a possible hepatic condition. The patient's presentation includes pruritus, unexplained weight loss, and recurring bacterial cholangitis. The laboratory results have revealed rising serum CA 19-9 levels and persistently elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and \u03b3-glutamyl transferase (GGT). Equivocal MRI/MRCP findings have shown cholangiographic features alternating between strictures and normal or slightly dilated segments. Given the patient's autoimmune history, there is a concern for autoimmune hepatitis overlap. Further evaluation is needed to assess the extent of bile duct dilation and the potential presence of small-duct PSC, as well as to address the underlying autoimmune component.",
  "Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 45-year-old male patient is being evaluated for a newly diagnosed hepatobiliary condition. The patient's medical history is notable for possible inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) symptoms, which have been accompanied by pruritus and osteopenia. The diagnostic workup has revealed cholangiographic features on equivocal MRI/MRCP, showing intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic strictures alternating with normal or slightly dilated segments. Laboratory tests have indicated persistently elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and \u03b3-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels, along with a rising serum CA 19-9. In addition, the patient has presented with pruritus that does not respond to conservative measures. The evaluation is essential to confirm the diagnosis of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) and to investigate the presence of small-duct PSC, as well as to address the possible overlap with IBD and the associated osteoporosis."
