  "Separation anxiety disorder_1": " 1. A 9-year-old patient, whose parents have a history of separation, presented with a myriad of symptoms indicative of separation anxiety disorder. The child exhibits persistent and excessive distress when anticipating or being away from home or loved ones, often expressing constant worry about losing a parent. This concern extends to fear of potential disasters or being lost, leading to refusal to be away from home or reluctance to sleep without a parent nearby. Additionally, the patient frequently complains of stomachaches and headaches, particularly when separation from a loved one is expected. These symptoms significantly impact the child's daily functioning and are excessive for their developmental age, meeting the criteria for separation anxiety disorder.",
  "Separation anxiety disorder_2": "2. A 7-year-old patient, with no notable family medical history, has been experiencing distressing symptoms indicative of separation anxiety disorder. The child demonstrates constant and excessive worry about losing a parent or loved one to an illness or disaster, often expressing fears of being lost or kidnapped, which results in a reluctance to be away from home. Furthermore, the patient refuses to be home alone and experiences repeated nightmares about separation. Clinically, the child's symptoms are accompanied by frequent complaints of headaches and stomachaches when anticipating separation from a parent or loved one. These manifestations significantly impact the patient's daily functioning and are considered excessive for their developmental age, supporting a diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder.",
  "Separation anxiety disorder_3": "3. A 10-year-old patient, with a family history of separation anxiety, presented with recurrent and excessive distress related to being away from home or loved ones, consistent with separation anxiety disorder. The child's constant worry about potential disasters or losing a parent has led to a marked reluctance to be away from home and a refusal to sleep without a parent nearby. Additionally, the patient frequently complains of headaches, stomachaches, and other somatic symptoms when separation from a loved one is anticipated. These symptoms exceed what is developmentally appropriate and significantly distress the child, affecting their daily functioning. In light of these findings, the diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder is highly pertinent."
