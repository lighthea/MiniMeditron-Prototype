  "Giant Cell Arteritis_1": "  Patient Description 1:\nA 75-year-old male patient, who has a history of polymyalgia rheumatica, presented with a persistent, severe head pain in the temple area. The pain is consistently rated at 8/10 in intensity. He reported scalp tenderness, jaw pain while chewing or opening his mouth wide, and a low-grade fever. The patient has been experiencing fatigue and unintended weight loss over the past few weeks. Given his age and medical history, there is a strong consideration for the diagnosis of the condition. Ophthalmologic examination revealed no vision loss or double vision at this time.",
  "Giant Cell Arteritis_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 68-year-old female patient came in reporting a two-week history of persistent, severe head pain localized in the temple area, which she consistently rates at 9/10 in intensity. The pain is accompanied by scalp tenderness and jaw pain, particularly when chewing or opening her mouth wide. The patient has also been experiencing intermittent low-grade fevers and notable fatigue. She denies unintended weight loss. Ophthalmologic examination is significant for the absence of vision loss or double vision. Given the patient's age, sex, and the observed symptoms, the diagnostic considerations are influenced by these factors.",
  "Giant Cell Arteritis_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 70-year-old male patient with no significant medical history presented with a four-week history of persistent, severe head pain centered in the temple area, with a pain intensity rating of 7/10. He complained of scalp tenderness and recurrent jaw pain, especially during chewing and when opening his mouth wide. The patient reported episodes of fever and significant fatigue, along with unintended weight loss. Ophthalmologic examination did not reveal any vision abnormalities at this time. Given the patient's age and the constellation of symptoms, the diagnostic process is influenced by age-related factors, and an assessment for the condition is warranted."
