  "Metabolic Bone Disease_1": "    Patient A, a 4-year-old child, presents with a complex medical history characterized by prolonged parenteral nutrition (PN) use due to short bowel syndrome. The patient exhibits pronounced musculoskeletal issues, including abnormal bone health and malnutrition-related concerns. Physical examination reveals skeletal deformities and a delay in developmental milestones. Radiographic imaging indicates classic features of rickets, such as growth plate widening and fraying. Despite previous aggressive interventions with high-dose calcium and phosphorus supplementation, the patient's condition has not significantly improved. Maternal vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy further complicates the diagnostic process. A comprehensive assessment is crucial to optimize the management of this challenging case.",
  "Metabolic Bone Disease_2": "Patient B is a 28-year-old male with a history of intestinal failure requiring long-term parenteral nutrition (PN). He presents with a constellation of symptoms indicative of metabolic bone disease. The patient reports persistent, debilitating bone pain (7/10 on the pain scale) and muscle weakness, significantly impacting his quality of life. Physical examination reveals tenderness over weight-bearing bones and reduced muscle strength. Despite receiving high-dose calcium and phosphorus supplementation as part of his PN regimen, the patient's bone health has progressively deteriorated. The presence of aluminum content in the PN solution further complicates the diagnostic process, necessitating a thorough evaluation to elucidate the underlying etiology and guide appropriate treatment strategies.",
  "Metabolic Bone Disease_3": "    Patient C, a 6-year-old child, is brought in by parents concerned about the development of abnormal bone health and recurrent musculoskeletal issues. The patient's medical history is notable for chronic liver disease, which has required prolonged parenteral nutrition (PN) support. Physical examination reveals skeletal abnormalities, including bowing of the legs and an asymmetric growth pattern. Radiographic assessment demonstrates features consistent with rickets. Despite receiving high-dose calcium and phosphorus supplementation, the patient's bone health has not improved, raising concerns about the underlying metabolic bone disease. The presence of aluminum content in the PN solution further complicates the diagnostic process. A comprehensive evaluation is essential to determine the etiology of the patient's condition and implement targeted interventions."
