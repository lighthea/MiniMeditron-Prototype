  "Atrial septal defect_1": "    Description 1:\n    A 34-year-old female patient, with a history of palpitations and exertional dyspnoea, presented with increasing fatigue and episodes of syncope. The patient reported a persistent sensation of rapid or irregular heartbeats. Despite her active lifestyle, she has been experiencing a decline in exercise tolerance. Physical examination revealed a pansystolic murmur along the left sternal border. The ECG showed findings consistent with atrial septal defect. Echocardiography revealed a moderate-sized defect with evidence of right heart enlargement. Given the presence of associated symptoms, the patient's condition warrants further evaluation and consideration of appropriate management.",
  "Atrial septal defect_2": "    Description 2:\n    A 45-year-old male patient, an avid runner, reported exertional dyspnoea and fatigue that have been progressively worsening over the past six months. He described occasional palpitations but no history of syncope. Despite his regular exercise routine, the patient has noticed a decline in his performance and increased effort to maintain the same level of activity. Physical examination revealed a soft systolic murmur at the upper left sternal border. Echocardiography showed a large atrial septal defect, and there were signs of right heart enlargement. The patient's lifestyle and the size of the defect are important factors to consider in determining the appropriate course of action.",
  "Atrial septal defect_3": "    Description 3:\n    A 50-year-old female patient presented with a history of palpitations, exertional dyspnoea, and fatigue. She reported occasional episodes of syncope. The patient had sought medical attention previously for similar symptoms but had not received a conclusive diagnosis. On examination, a prominent pansystolic murmur was auscultated at the left sternal border. Echocardiography revealed a small atrial septal defect, with evidence of right heart enlargement. Given the recurrent symptoms and the increased risk of stroke associated with atrial septal defects, further evaluation and management options need to be explored."
