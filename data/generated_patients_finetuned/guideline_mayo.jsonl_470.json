  "Heat exhaustion_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 34-year-old construction worker with a history of prolonged sun exposure presented with symptoms indicative of heat-related illness. The patient reported heavy sweating, consistent dizziness, and a persistent headache rated at 6/10 in severity. On examination, he exhibited cool, moist skin with goosebumps, along with a weak and rapid pulse. Notably, the patient's rectal temperature was measured at 103.5 F (39.7 C). Although he had attempted self-care measures, such as increased hydration, the symptoms persisted. Given the nature of the patient's occupation and the contextual information of elevated body temperature, a comprehensive evaluation is warranted to determine the appropriate management approach.",
  "Heat exhaustion_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 28-year-old recreational hiker presented with concerning symptoms after a day-long outdoor trek in hot weather conditions. The patient described a heavy sensation of fatigue, accompanied by recurrent episodes of faintness, nausea, and muscle cramps, particularly in the lower limbs. She reported a persisting headache, rated at 5/10 in intensity. Physical examination revealed cool, moist skin with visible goosebumps, along with a weak and rapid pulse. Although her blood pressure was within normal limits, the symptoms were exacerbated upon standing.
