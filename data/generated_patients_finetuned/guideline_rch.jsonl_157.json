  "Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)_1": "    Description 1:\n    A 14-year-old female patient, with a known history of Type 1 diabetes mellitus, presented with a complex set of symptoms. The patient's Blood Glucose Level (BGL) was markedly elevated at 15.5 mmol/L, and she exhibited an altered conscious state, marked by irritability and lethargy. Additionally, the presence of ketosis, dehydration, and vomiting was observed. The patient's condition was further complicated by a severe headache. It is noteworthy that the young patient had experienced incontinence and thermal instability. Given the context of inadequate insulin in an adolescent with known diabetes, as well as the combination of these symptoms, a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is imperative.",

The patient presented with a Blood Glucose Level (BGL) of 17.2 mmol/L, indicating hyperglycemia. The altered conscious state was evident as the child appeared irritable and lethargic. Moreover, ketosis and vomiting were noted, along with signs of dehydration. The patient's parents reported a recent illness preceding the onset of these symptoms.
