  "Preeclampsia_1": "1. A 28-year-old pregnant woman, gravida 1, para 0, at 34 weeks of gestation, presented with a persistent, severe headache (rated 8/10 for intensity) that is not relieved by over-the-counter pain medication. She has also experienced changes in her vision, describing it as \"seeing flashing lights\" and occasional blurring. The patient's blood pressure readings have consistently been elevated, with values ranging between 140/90 mmHg and 160/100 mmHg. Additionally, she has noticed swelling in her hands and face. Urinalysis revealed the presence of protein. The patient has no history of chronic hypertension or renal disease. However, she is obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 32, and her family history is notable for preeclampsia in her mother. Given her clinical presentation and the contextual factors, including nulliparity, obesity, and family history of preeclampsia, a comprehensive assessment for preeclampsia is warranted.",
  "Preeclampsia_2": "2. A 35-year-old pregnant patient, gravida 2, para 1, at 30 weeks of gestation, was referred to our clinic with a constellation of concerning symptoms. She reported a persistent, severe headache (rated 9/10 for intensity) that has been unresponsive to analgesics. The patient also mentioned abdominal pain in the epigastric region, associated with nausea and vomiting. Her blood pressure readings have been consistently elevated, ranging from 150/95 mmHg to 170/110 mmHg. Urinalysis revealed the presence of protein, further raising the suspicion of preeclampsia. Notably, the patient's history is significant for a previous pregnancy affected by preeclampsia. She has a family history of the condition, and her age is 35 years. These contextual factors, along with her presenting symptoms, necessitate a thorough evaluation for preeclampsia.",
  "Preeclampsia_3": "3. A 25-year-old pregnant woman, gravida 3, para 2, presented to the obstetrics clinic at 38 weeks of gestation with several worrisome symptoms. She reported a persistent, pounding headache (rated 7/10 for intensity) and noted changes in her vision, describing blurriness and occasional double vision. The patient experienced epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, accompanied by nausea and shortness of breath. Her blood pressure readings have been elevated, ranging from 140/90 mmHg to 160/100 mmHg, and urinalysis revealed the presence of protein. Notably, she has a history of preeclampsia in her previous pregnancy. Given her age, nulliparity, and personal history, the suspicion for recurrent preeclampsia is high, and a comprehensive assessment is essential to guide further management."
