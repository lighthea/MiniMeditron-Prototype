  "Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis_1": "    CASE 1:\n    A 62-year-old male patient, with a past medical history significant for hypertension, presents with intermittent episodes of transient visual disturbances and mild numbness on the right side of his face and hand. These episodes occur several times a week, lasting for a few minutes each time. The patient describes the visual disturbances as a \"curtain-like\" sensation over his right eye, and rates the pain associated with the numbness as 2/10. Despite the absence of a specific pattern or provoking factors, the recurrence of these episodes has raised concerns. The patient is currently on antihypertensive medication, and his blood pressure is well-controlled. Examination findings are unremarkable, but given the clinical presentation and the patient's medical history, further evaluation is warranted to determine the underlying etiology.",
  "Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis_2": "    CASE 2:\n    A 55-year-old female patient, a non-smoker, presents with a history of recurrent, unexplained episodes of dizziness and vertigo, associated with a sensation of \"pulsating\" noises in her left ear. These episodes occur at least twice a week and can last for several minutes, with an intensity of 4/10 for the associated discomfort. The dizziness is often exacerbated with sudden head movements. The patient has no significant medical history and is not on any regular medications. Physical examination, including a thorough neurological assessment, reveals no abnormalities. However, the recurrent nature of her symptoms and their impact on her daily activities have prompted further investigation to determine the underlying cause.",
  "Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis_3": "    CASE 3:\n    A 68-year-old male patient, with a history of smoking and hypertension, reports episodes of transient weakness in his right arm and leg, accompanied by a sensation of \"heaviness\" in the same limbs. These episodes occur approximately three to four times a week, lasting for 5-10 minutes each time, with a pain intensity of 3/10. The patient has noticed that the weakness tends to occur more frequently during physical exertion or when he is under stress. Despite these episodes, his overall functional status remains relatively stable. On examination, there are no focal neurological deficits, but the concerning pattern of his symptoms, in the context of his medical history, necessitates a comprehensive assessment to determine the underlying pathology."
