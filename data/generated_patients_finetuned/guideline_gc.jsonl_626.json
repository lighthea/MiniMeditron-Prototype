  "ERCP adverse events_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 45-year-old female patient, with a history of recurrent biliary colic, presented with severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, scoring 8/10 on the visual analog scale (VAS). The pain started within 24 hours after an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure for biliary stone extraction. She also experienced mild to moderate jaundice and persistent fever. Given her high-risk profile and the observed symptoms, there is a concern for post-ERCP pancreatitis, as well as the possibility of incomplete biliary drainage contributing to her condition.",
  "ERCP adverse events_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 55-year-old male patient, known for a history of cholelithiasis, underwent an elective ERCP procedure for biliary stone extraction. However, the intervention was complicated by biliary stone extraction difficulties, requiring prolonged manipulation. Subsequently, the patient developed moderate epigastric pain (VAS 5/10), accompanied by a low-grade fever and mild bleeding at the site of the ERCP. These adverse events are indicative of a post-ERCP complication, necessitating a comprehensive assessment to address the underlying issues of bleeding and potential infection.",
  "ERCP adverse events_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 60-year-old male patient with a documented coagulopathy underwent an ERCP for diagnostic evaluation of recurrent upper abdominal pain. Following the procedure, the patient developed sudden-onset, severe epigastric pain (VAS 9/10), associated with tachycardia and hypotension. There is also a history of food and intravenous contrast allergies. The clinical presentation is concerning for a severe adverse event post-ERCP, including the possibility of periampullary or instrument-related perforations, which may lead to significant morbidity. Immediate intervention and diagnostic evaluation are imperative in this high-risk scenario."
