  "Ebstein anomaly_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 25-year-old female patient, with a history of pregnancy and prenatal exposure to lithium, presented with concerning cardiovascular symptoms. She reported persistent fatigue (rated 6/10), accompanied by a feeling of a pounding heart, and episodes of irregular heartbeats. Additionally, the patient experienced shortness of breath during physical activities. On examination, bluish discoloration of the lips and fingernails was noted. Given the contextual information of prenatal lithium exposure, the presence of these symptoms raises concerns for a potential cardiac anomaly, necessitating comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.",
  "Ebstein anomaly_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 32-year-old male patient, without significant medical history, reported worrisome cardiac symptoms. He described a persistent feeling of fatigue (rated 7/10) and noted a pronounced sensation of a rapid, pounding heartbeat, often accompanied by irregular heart rhythms. The patient experienced episodes of shortness of breath, particularly during physical exertion. On examination, bluish discoloration of the lips and fingernails was observed. These symptoms, in the absence of any known heart conditions, prompt the need for a thorough diagnostic assessment to elucidate the underlying etiology of the patient's cardiovascular complaints.",
  "Ebstein anomaly_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 2-month-old infant, born with a complex medical history, including prenatal exposure to certain medications, presented with concerning cardiac symptoms. The child exhibited persistent fatigue, as evidenced by irritability and decreased feeding, and the parents reported a frequent observation of blue or gray discoloration of the lips and fingernails. Additionally, there was a documented sensation of a rapid heartbeat and irregular heart rhythms. These symptoms, in the context of the infant's prenatal medication exposure, underscore the necessity for a comprehensive diagnostic workup to evaluate the nature and extent of the observed cardiovascular anomalies. The presence of other heart problems, as well as the potential genetic and environmental factors, further complicates the diagnostic considerations."
