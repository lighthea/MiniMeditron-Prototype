  "Pediatric Venous Thromboembolism_2": "A 16-year-old male patient, with a medical history notable for homozygous protein C deficiency, presented with a new-onset of localized swelling and tenderness in his left lower extremity. The pain was rated at 6/10 and had persisted for the past 3 days. There were no signs of skin discoloration or increased warmth over the affected area. The patient's family reported no recent trauma or prolonged immobilization. Given the patient's genetic profile and the absence of provoking factors, the presence of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a concerning clinical finding, necessitating further diagnostic evaluation and age-appropriate reference ranges for interpretation.",
  "Pediatric Venous Thromboembolism_4": "A 14-year-old female, who had undergone liver transplantation 6 months ago, was brought to the emergency department with acute-onset chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient described her chest pain as sharp and rated it at 8/10 in intensity. It had worsened with deep inspiration. She also reported a sense of anxiety. On examination, tachypnea and tachycardia were noted. The patient's oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. Given the post-transplantation status and the presence of acute cardiopulmonary symptoms, including pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea, the diagnostic consideration of symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) is paramount, as well as the requirement of venous access for further investigation and treatment.",
  "Pediatric Venous Thromboembolism_6": "A 12-year-old male, without any significant medical history, was admitted to the pediatric ward for persistent headache, accompanied by vomiting and somnolence. The intensity of his headache was described as 7/10. A neurological examination revealed papilledema. Imaging studies confirmed the presence of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CSVT). The patient's response to standard anticoagulation treatment needed to be closely monitored, considering the central nervous system involvement and the atypical presentation in this age group. Additionally, the age-appropriate reference ranges and the diagnostic significance of imaging findings should guide the ongoing management of this pediatric venous thromboembolism."
