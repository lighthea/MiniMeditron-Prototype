  "Cardiac Amyloidosis_1": "     Patient Description 1:\n     A 62-year-old male patient, with a history of unexplained weight loss and fatigue, presented with atypical chest pain and dyspnea during exertion. Cardiac evaluation revealed a notable increase in left ventricular (LV) wall thickness, as observed on SSFP cine CMR, exceeding the upper limit of normal for his sex. Additionally, the patient exhibited a global extracellular volume fraction (ECV) greater than 0.40 and diffuse late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Notably, abnormal gadolinium kinetics, typical for amyloidosis, were observed, with myocardial nulling occurring prior to blood pool nulling. The target to background ratio in the LV myocardium to blood pool was found to be greater than 1.5, and the retention index exceeded 0.030 min\u00b7-1. The patient's medical history is pertinent for an extracardiac biopsy-proven amyloidosis. A comprehensive workup, including age-adjusted NT-pro BNP and Troponin assessment, has been inconclusive, and there is an absence of a clonal plasma cell process as assessed by serum FLCs and serum and urine immunofixation.",
  "Cardiac Amyloidosis_2": "     Patient Description 2:\n     A 58-year-old female patient, with a medical history of recurrent pleural effusions, was referred for cardiac evaluation due to exertional dyspnea and episodes of syncope. Cardiac imaging revealed left ventricular (LV) wall thickness that surpassed the upper limit of normal for her sex, as observed on SSFP cine CMR. Global extracellular volume fraction (ECV) was markedly elevated, exceeding 0.40, and diffuse late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) was present. The patient exhibited abnormal gadolinium kinetics, characteristic of amyloidosis, with myocardial nulling preceding blood pool nulling. Moreover, the target to background ratio in the LV myocardium to blood pool was determined to be greater than 1.5, and the retention index was higher than 0.030 min\u00b7-1. This presentation is further complicated by a history of extracardiac biopsy-proven amyloidosis. Despite an extensive diagnostic workup, including age-adjusted NT-pro BNP and Troponin assessment, there is an absence of a clonal plasma cell process, as confirmed by serum FLCs and serum and urine immunofixation.",
  "Cardiac Amyloidosis_3": "     Patient Description 3:\n     A 64-year-old male patient, known for a history of peripheral neuropathy and carpal tunnel syndrome, presented with exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. Cardiac imaging revealed an increase in left ventricular (LV) wall thickness, which exceeded the upper limit of normal for his sex on SSFP cine CMR. The patient exhibited a global extracellular volume fraction (ECV) greater than 0.40, along with diffuse late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Notably, abnormal gadolinium kinetics, typical for amyloidosis, were observed, with myocardial nulling occurring prior to blood pool nulling. The target to background ratio in the LV myocardium to blood pool was found to be higher than 1.5, and the retention index exceeded 0.030 min\u00b7-1. The clinical context is significant, given the patient's history of extracardiac biopsy-proven amyloidosis. Despite an extensive diagnostic workup, including age-adjusted NT-pro BNP and Troponin assessment, there is an absence of a clonal plasma cell process, as confirmed by serum FLCs and serum and urine immunofixation."
