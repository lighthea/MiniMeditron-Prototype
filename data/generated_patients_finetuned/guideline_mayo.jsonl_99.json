  "Avascular necrosis_1": "Description 1:\nA 45-year-old male patient presented with a persistent, dull ache in his left hip, which he described as 6/10 in severity, exacerbated when bearing weight. The pain has been gradually developing over the past few months and is also present when he lies down. Notably, the patient has a history of prolonged high-dose steroid medication use for an autoimmune condition. Physical examination reveals tenderness in the affected hip joint. Given the clinical presentation and the patient's medical history, avascular necrosis is a significant consideration in the differential diagnosis.",
  "Avascular necrosis_2": "Description 2:\nA 50-year-old female patient visited our clinic, reporting aching pain in her right shoulder and upper arm, which she rated at 5/10 in intensity. The pain has been insidiously progressing over the past six months, and it persists even at rest. The patient has no history of trauma or excessive alcohol consumption. However, she does have a family history of hip-related joint issues. Physical examination revealed localized tenderness in the affected shoulder joint. Given the gradual onset of pain, its persistence at rest, and the family history, avascular necrosis is a primary concern for this patient.",
  "Avascular necrosis_3": "Description 3:\nA 55-year-old male patient presented with chronic, achy pain in his right knee, which he rated as 7/10 in severity and described as constant. The pain has been ongoing for nearly a year and does not subside with rest. The patient has a history of joint trauma due to a sports-related injury. Physical examination revealed tenderness and restricted range of motion in the affected knee joint. Given the prolonged pain, lack of relief with rest, and the history of joint trauma, avascular necrosis is a notable diagnostic consideration in this case."
