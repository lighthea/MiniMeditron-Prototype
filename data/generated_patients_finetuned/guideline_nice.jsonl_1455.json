  "Mitral valve surgery_1": "    Patient A, a 60-year-old male with a history of rheumatic fever in his adolescence, presents with gradually worsening exertional dyspnea (NYHA Class II-III) and intermittent episodes of palpitations. He describes his dyspnea as moderately severe, with a score of 6/10 on the pain scale. On auscultation, there is a loud S1 and an opening snap followed by a diastolic rumble. Echocardiography reveals severe mitral stenosis with a valve area of 0.9 cm\u00b2. The patient's past medical history is pertinent for recurrent rheumatic fever and a previous episode of infective endocarditis, for which he completed a course of antibiotics. His current symptoms, along with the echocardiographic findings, underscore the need for further evaluation in the context of operative field visualization for potential mitral valve surgery.",
  "Mitral valve surgery_2": "    Patient B, a 45-year-old female, presents with a complex medical history, including a prior mitral valve repair for mitral regurgitation. She now reports a gradual onset of dyspnea at rest and orthopnea, with a high severity score of 8/10 for dyspnea. On auscultation, a regurgitant murmur is heard, and the patient's echocardiogram shows severe mitral regurgitation with a widened regurgitant orifice. Despite her previous surgical intervention, she is now experiencing recurrent symptoms, indicative of significant mitral valve dysfunction. Cardiopulmonary bypass considerations are essential in the assessment of her condition and in planning for potential re-intervention.",
  "Mitral valve surgery_3": "    Patient C, a 55-year-old male, with a long-standing history of rheumatic heart disease, presents with a constellation of symptoms, including dyspnea (NYHA Class III), paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and palpitations attributed to documented atrial fibrillation. He describes his dyspnea as moderately severe, with a pain score of 7/10. Auscultation reveals an irregularly irregular rhythm and a loud pansystolic murmur over the apex. Echocardiography demonstrates severe mitral regurgitation, along with atrial fibrillation. The patient's history of rheumatic heart disease underscores the chronic nature of his valvular pathology. Given his atrial fibrillation and the associated risk of thromboembolic stroke, a comprehensive management plan, considering the operative field visualization and anticoagulation strategies, is crucial in his case."
