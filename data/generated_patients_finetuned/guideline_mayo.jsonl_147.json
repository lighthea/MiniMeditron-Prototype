  "Breast Cyst_2": "A 34-year-old female patient with a pertinent medical history of benign breast lumps presented with a recurring symptom. She described a persistent smooth, easily movable lump with well-defined edges in her right breast. The patient reported a nipple discharge, varying in color from clear to dark brown. Additionally, she experienced cyclical breast pain and tenderness in the localized lump area, which notably intensified before her menstrual period and subsided afterward. The increase in lump size and breast tenderness aligned with her menstrual cycle. Physical examination revealed a palpable, round mass in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. Given the patient's history and the observed symptoms, further evaluation is warranted to assess the nature of the breast condition and determine an appropriate management plan.",
  "Breast Cyst_4": "A 40-year-old woman, without a significant medical history, presented with a concerning breast symptom. She reported the presence of a smooth, round lump with distinct edges in her left breast, which she had noticed and monitored for the past six weeks. The patient described occasional nipple discharge, ranging in color from yellow to straw-colored. Furthermore, she experienced localized breast pain and tenderness, particularly before her menstrual period, along with an observed increase in the lump size during this premenstrual phase. Postmenstrual resolution of the symptoms was noted, including a decrease in the size of the lump. Clinical examination revealed an easily movable mass in the lower inner quadrant of the left breast. Given the presented symptoms and the patient's lack of prior breast issues, a comprehensive assessment is necessary to elucidate the underlying etiology and guide appropriate management.",
  "Breast Cyst_6": "A 48-year-old woman, with a family history of benign breast conditions, visited the clinic due to a recurrent breast concern. She described a persistent, easily movable lump with smooth edges in her right breast, which she had been monitoring for the last three months. The patient reported intermittent nipple discharge, often with a dark brown color. Additionally, she experienced cyclical breast pain and tenderness, particularly before her menstrual period, and noted an increase in the lump's size during this premenstrual phase. Postmenstrual resolution of symptoms was observed, accompanied by a decrease in the lump size. Clinical examination revealed a palpable, round mass in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. Given the patient's family history and the documented symptoms, a comprehensive diagnostic assessment is essential to determine the nature of the breast condition and establish an individualized management plan."
