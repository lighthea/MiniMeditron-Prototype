  "Avian Flu (Bird Flu)_1": "    **Patient Description 1:**\n    \n    A 45-year-old male patient, Mr. X, with a history of poultry farming, presented with a constellation of concerning symptoms. He reported a high fever, measured at 103\u00b0F, along with severe muscle and body aches (pain level 7/10), and persistent headaches. Additionally, he described a sore throat, cough, and a runny nose. Notably, Mr. X has been involved in handling live birds without adequate protective gear. Given his occupation and the reported symptoms, there is a high index of suspicion for a potential avian flu (bird flu) diagnosis. ",
  "Avian Flu (Bird Flu)_2": "    **Patient Description 2:**\n    \n    Mrs. Y, a 30-year-old female, visited our clinic with an acute onset of symptoms. She complained of a cough, which she classified as moderately severe, with a pain level of 6/10. Mrs. Y also reported eye redness (conjunctivitis), a sore throat, and pronounced tiredness. Notably, she disclosed a recent history of exposure to sick birds in her neighborhood. Her presentation, coupled with the contextual information, raises significant concern for avian flu, and further assessment is warranted.",
  "Avian Flu (Bird Flu)_3": "    **Patient Description 3:**\n    \n    In the emergency department, we evaluated a 55-year-old male patient, Mr. Z, who presented with alarming respiratory symptoms. He experienced shortness of breath and reported difficulty breathing, which he described as severe, with a pain level of 8/10. This was accompanied by a high-grade fever, muscle aches, and episodes of vomiting. Importantly, Mr. Z is a bird handler by profession. The combination of his occupation, respiratory distress, and the reported symptoms necessitates urgent attention to rule out avian flu and its potential complications."
