  "Cardiac arrest_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    \n    A 45-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension and obesity was found unresponsive at home by family members. Upon assessment, the patient was not breathing normally, and there was no palpable pulse. Family members reported that the patient had complained of chest pain and mild shortness of breath in the days leading up to the incident. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated at the scene by a family member, who was wearing a face mask. The patient's unresponsiveness, absence of normal breathing, and lack of pulse are concerning for a cardiac event. Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the potential aerosolization of the virus during CPR, and the risk of COVID-19 exposure, the diagnostic and management approach needs to consider these contextual factors.",
  "Cardiac arrest_3": "    A 60-year-old female patient, known for a history of coronary artery disease, presented to the emergency department with a sudden loss of consciousness. On arrival, she was unresponsive, not breathing normally, and had no detectable pulse. Bystander reports indicated that the patient had experienced episodes of chest pain and exertional dyspnea in the week preceding this event. The patient's medical history is notable for a previous myocardial infarction, for which she underwent percutaneous coronary intervention. The current presentation raises concerns for a cardiac-related issue, given the patient's established cardiovascular disease. It is important to be mindful of the diagnostic challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the presence of staff wearing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and the potential aerosolization of the virus during resuscitation efforts.",
  "Cardiac arrest_5": "    A 50-year-old male patient, with a known history of smoking and family history of premature coronary artery disease, was brought to the emergency department after collapsing at his workplace. On assessment, the patient was unresponsive, not breathing normally, and lacked a palpable pulse. Co-workers reported that the patient had been complaining of recurrent episodes of chest tightness and shortness of breath for which he had not sought medical attention. The absence of responsiveness, abnormal breathing, and absence of a pulse raise concerns for a cardiac event in this high-risk individual. Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the potential aerosolization of the virus during resuscitation, the diagnostic approach needs to account for these contextual factors."
