  "Breast Cancer_1": "\n**Case 1:**\nA 47-year-old female patient with a significant medical history of high-risk early-stage TNBC presented with persistent, intense pain (rated 8/10) in her left breast, accompanied by a palpable mass. Despite prior treatments involving adjuvant chemotherapy, she has now developed an unresectable, locally advanced tumor. The PD-L1 status and CPS score are crucial in determining the next course of action for this patient.",
  "Breast Cancer_2": "**Case 2:**\nA 56-year-old woman, with a known history of locally advanced breast cancer, presented with new-onset bone pain and unintentional weight loss. The pain, primarily located in her spine and hips, is described as severe (rated 9/10) and has been affecting her mobility. Imaging studies revealed the presence of metastasis to the skeletal system. The TNBC stage and receptor profiles (ER/PR/HER2) will significantly influence the treatment strategy for this patient.",
  "Breast Cancer_3": "**Case 3:**\nA 38-year-old female patient, previously diagnosed with stage II TNBC, is now reporting a persistent, dull ache (rated 4/10) in her right breast. Clinical examination has identified a new palpable mass, raising concerns about disease progression to stage III. The patient's TNBC stage and the receptor profiles (ER/PR/HER2) will play a critical role in guiding subsequent diagnostic and treatment interventions."
