  "Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1)_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 40-year-old male with a significant family history of endocrine disorders presented with progressively worsening tiredness, rated at 6/10 on the pain scale. The fatigue has been persistent for the last six months and is not alleviated by rest. Additionally, the patient reported recurrent bone pain, particularly in the long bones of the lower extremities, which he described as a dull, aching sensation, with a pain level of 4/10. Notably, he has experienced two unexplained broken bones in the past three years, raising concerns. The patient's medical history is pertinent for the occurrence of kidney stones three years ago, and he has a documented history of ulcers in the stomach, which required treatment. Given the constellation of symptoms and the strong family history, further evaluation for multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1) is warranted.",
  "Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1)_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 35-year-old female, with a family history of MEN 1, presented with persistent tiredness, rated at 7/10 in severity, despite adequate sleep and rest. The fatigue has been ongoing for eight months and is significantly impacting her daily functioning. The patient reported a recent episode of bone pain, primarily localized in the ribs and sternum, with a sharp, intermittent nature, and a pain level of 5/10. She denied any trauma or injury that could account for the pain. No history of broken bones was reported. However, the patient experienced recurrent kidney stones over the past two years, requiring multiple interventions. Given her family history and the combination of symptoms, there is a strong suspicion of multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1), necessitating further diagnostic assessment.",
  "Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1)_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 50-year-old male, without a known family history of MEN 1, presented with chronic tiredness, which he rated at 5/10 in intensity. The fatigue has persisted for four months and is not relieved by rest. The patient reported a history of recurrent bone pain, predominantly in the spine and hips, described as a deep, dull ache, with a pain level of 3/10. There were no documented incidents of broken bones. However, he recently experienced a kidney stone episode, adding to his concern. Despite no previous history of ulcers, the patient described occasional episodes of stomach discomfort. Given the atypical presentation and the absence of a family history, the diagnostic evaluation for multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1), is still indicated, although the contextual factors differ from the typical presentation."
