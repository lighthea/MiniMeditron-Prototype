  "Ecmo_1": "   Description 1:\n   \n   A 6-year-old pediatric patient, who is currently on ECMO support, is presenting with persistent tachycardia, ranging between 140-160 beats per minute, despite optimal sedation and analgesia. The patient has a history of congenital heart disease and underwent cardiac surgery two weeks ago, following which ECMO was initiated due to post-operative cardiogenic shock. Additionally, the patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a progressive metabolic acidosis, with a pH of 7.25 and lactate levels of 5 mmol/L. Despite appropriate ventilation and perfusion, the acidosis persists. The medical team should be vigilant in monitoring and managing the patient's condition, as these symptoms may denote a specific complication related to the ECMO therapy.",
  "Ecmo_2": "   Description 2:\n   \n   A 4-year-old child on ECMO support is exhibiting concerning symptoms. The patient, who underwent liver transplantation and was subsequently placed on veno-arterial ECMO due to primary graft dysfunction, is now presenting with recurrent episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding, characterized by hematemesis and melena. The bleeding episodes have resulted in a drop in the patient's hemoglobin levels to 8 g/dL, necessitating blood transfusions. The etiology of the gastrointestinal bleeding in this pediatric ECMO patient needs to be promptly investigated, considering the history of liver transplantation and the potential hemostatic challenges associated with ECMO support.",
  "Ecmo_4": "   In the pediatric ICU, a 2-year-old patient is currently on ECMO following respiratory failure secondary to a viral-induced severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's clinical course is complicated by the development of generalized tonic-clonic seizures that are not controlled by first-line antiepileptic medications. The frequency of seizures has escalated, occurring every 4-6 hours, and their duration ranges from 3 to 5 minutes. Despite adjusting the sedation regimen, the patient remains agitated and continues to experience these seizures. The medical history is significant for the absence of any prior neurological issues. The healthcare team should recognize that the occurrence of seizures in this ECMO-supported patient necessitates a comprehensive evaluation to determine the underlying cause and institute appropriate treatment, considering the unique challenges posed by the patient's critical condition."
