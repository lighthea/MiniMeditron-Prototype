  "Primary progressive aphasia_1": "    Patient A, a 58-year-old, highly educated individual, was referred for evaluation due to a concerning language impairment. The patient, who has no history of learning disabilities, has been experiencing a gradual onset of language difficulties over the past two years. She reports severe frustration and feels \"trapped\" in conversations as she struggles to understand the meaning of words, particularly when used in complex sentences. Her family has noticed frequent pausing and hesitancy during her speech, often resulting in difficulty formulating sentences and using grammar incorrectly. Despite extensive language therapy, her condition continues to worsen. The diagnostic process should carefully consider the patient's educational and familial background, as well as the presence of certain gene changes.",
  "Primary progressive aphasia_2": "    Patient B, a 64-year-old retired gentleman, presented with a progressive language disorder that has been ongoing for three years. He described an overwhelming sense of distress associated with his inability to name common objects and comprehend written or spoken language, especially single words. His family has observed his pronounced trouble in understanding lengthy sentences and noted a decline in his ability to repeat phrases or sentences accurately. The patient's written and spoken language is marked by poor grammar, and he often makes errors in speech sounds. Despite his active lifestyle, which includes regular mental exercises, there has been no improvement in his condition. An in-depth assessment is warranted to determine the underlying cause of his primary progressive aphasia.",
  "Primary progressive aphasia_3": "    Patient C, a 60-year-old individual with no history of learning disabilities, sought medical attention for a persistent language impairment. Over the past four years, he has struggled with understanding spoken language, particularly when it involves complex sentences. He experiences notable difficulty in formulating sentences and frequently exhibits hesitancy during speech, during which he searches for words. His family has observed a decline in his ability to name objects and noted his poor grammar in both written and spoken language. Furthermore, the patient has developed problems with speaking, including errors in speech sounds (apraxia of speech). Despite attempts at speech therapy, his condition continues to deteriorate. Given the presence of these symptoms and the lack of improvement with intervention, a comprehensive diagnostic assessment is essential to identify the underlying etiology of his primary progressive aphasia."
