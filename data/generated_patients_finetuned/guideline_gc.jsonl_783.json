  "Chemotherapy-Na\u00efve Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC)_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 68-year-old male with a significant medical history of untreated prostate cancer presented with a notable decline in his quality of life, reporting increased fatigue, reduced physical activity, and diminished overall well-being. He also described moderate bone pain (rated 5/10 on the pain scale) that has been persistent in his lower back and pelvis. Laboratory tests revealed a rapidly accelerating PSA doubling time. Radiographic imaging confirmed the presence of metastases (M1a/M1s CRPC). The patient has not undergone any previous chemotherapy treatments. These findings raise concerns for Chemotherapy-Na\u00efve Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer and highlight the urgent need for a comprehensive oncological evaluation and treatment strategy.",
  "Chemotherapy-Na\u00efve Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC)_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 75-year-old male, previously diagnosed with prostate cancer, reported to the clinic with an array of symptoms indicative of a decline in his overall quality of life. He experienced notable fatigue, reduced exercise tolerance, and an evident decrease in his physical and social activities. The patient described persistent bone pain, predominantly localized in his lower back and pelvis, which he rated at 6/10 for severity. Laboratory results demonstrated a rapidly accelerating PSA doubling time. Radiographic imaging confirmed the presence of metastases (M1a/M1s CRPC). Notably, the patient's medical history did not include any prior exposure to chemotherapy. These clinical manifestations strongly suggest the presence of Chemotherapy-Na\u00efve Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer, necessitating an immediate oncological assessment and the formulation of an appropriate treatment plan.",
  "Chemotherapy-Na\u00efve Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC)_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 71-year-old male patient, previously diagnosed with prostate cancer, presented with a constellation of symptoms indicative of a decreased quality of life and declining health status. He reported persistent fatigue, a marked reduction in his physical and social activities, and a notable decrease in overall well-being. The patient experienced moderate bone pain, primarily localized in the lower back and pelvis, with a pain severity rating of 4/10. Laboratory investigations revealed a rapidly accelerating PSA doubling time, raising concerns for the presence of metastases. Subsequent radiographic imaging confirmed the existence of metastatic lesions (M1a/M1s CRPC). Importantly, the patient had not undergone any prior chemotherapy treatments. These clinical findings strongly indicate the presence of Chemotherapy-Na\u00efve Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer, underscoring the need for an urgent oncological evaluation and the initiation of an appropriate treatment regimen."
