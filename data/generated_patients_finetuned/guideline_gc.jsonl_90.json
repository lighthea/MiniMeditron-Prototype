  "Vestibular Schwannomas_1": "    Description 1:\n    A 45-year-old male patient presented with a six-month history of persistent tinnitus in his left ear, which he described as a high-pitched ringing sensation (3/10 on the pain scale) that has been significantly affecting his quality of life. He also reported a gradual hearing loss in the same ear, accompanied by occasional episodes of dizziness. On examination, cranial nerve deficits were noted, including facial weakness and reduced corneal reflex. The patient has no significant medical history of ear-related conditions. Diagnostic evaluation, including radiographic imaging, is essential to assess the presence and size of the underlying lesion, given the combination of tinnitus, hearing loss, and cranial nerve abnormalities.",
  "Vestibular Schwannomas_2": "    Description 2:\n    A 60-year-old female patient, with a history of untreated tinnitus in her right ear for the past two years, presented with a recent onset of hearing loss on the same side, rated at 5/10 in intensity, along with occasional vertigo spells. The hearing impairment has notably impacted her ability to communicate in social settings. Cranial nerve examination revealed subtle deficits, including reduced facial sensation and mild facial weakness. Diagnostic workup is crucial, considering the progression of tinnitus to hearing loss, the presence of cranial nerve abnormalities, and the patient's age, to assess the extent and size of the lesion and its impact on her symptoms.",
  "Vestibular Schwannomas_3": "    Description 3:\n    A 50-year-old male patient, a heavy machinery operator, reported a one-year history of intermittent tinnitus in his right ear, which he described as a persistent, low-pitched buzzing sensation (2/10 in severity). He noticed a gradual hearing loss in the same ear, which has not significantly affected his occupational performance. However, he has recently experienced episodes of dizziness and imbalance. On examination, cranial nerve deficits were observed, including reduced sensation in the right facial area. Given the patient's occupational noise exposure, the presence of tinnitus, hearing loss, and cranial nerve abnormalities, diagnostic assessment, including radiographic imaging, is vital to evaluate the underlying condition and its potential impact on the patient's vestibular and auditory functions."
