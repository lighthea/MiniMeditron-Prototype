  "Perioperative Visual Loss Associated with Spine Surgery_1": "    # Patient Description 1\n    A 62-year-old female patient, with a medical history notable for hypertension and preoperative anemia, presented with a concerning symptom. The patient reported a gradual and painless visual loss in both eyes, which was first noticed two days after undergoing a lengthy spine surgery. The visual impairment has persisted and is described as moderately severe, significantly impacting her ability to perceive light and distinguish shapes. Ophthalmologic examination revealed no apparent abnormalities in the anterior or posterior segments of the eyes. Given the patient's preexisting conditions and the prolonged nature of the surgical procedure, further evaluation is warranted to elucidate the etiology of the perioperative visual loss.",
  "Perioperative Visual Loss Associated with Spine Surgery_2": "    # Patient Description 2\n    A 58-year-old male patient, known for a history of diabetes and obesity, experienced a distressing visual complication following an extensive spine surgery. The patient's visual loss, which commenced 24 hours post-operation, is characterized by a severe and sudden diminution in both eyes. He describes it as a profound, debilitating blindness, with an inability to detect light or shapes. Despite the absence of ocular pain, the visual impairment has persisted. Ophthalmic examination did not reveal any acute abnormalities in the anterior or posterior segments. Given the patient's diabetes, obesity, and the substantial blood loss during surgery, a comprehensive assessment is vital to determine the underlying cause of the perioperative visual loss.",
  "Perioperative Visual Loss Associated with Spine Surgery_3": "    # Patient Description 3\n    An 68-year-old male patient, who has a history of coronary artery disease and tobacco use, presented with a worrisome visual symptom following a complex spine surgery. The patient reported a gradual visual loss, which he first noticed 3 days post-surgery. The visual impairment is moderate in severity, with a persistent difficulty in discerning shapes and objects. The patient's lifestyle includes ongoing tobacco use. Although there is no associated pain, the visual loss has not improved. Ophthalmologic examination did not reveal acute abnormalities in the eyes. Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease, tobacco use, and the prolonged nature of the surgical procedure, a comprehensive diagnostic assessment is essential to determine the underlying cause of the perioperative visual loss."
