  "Nutritional rickets_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 3-year-old child, with a history of limited sun exposure due to residing in a northern climate, presented with non-specific bony and muscular pain, especially in the lower limbs, rated at 4/10 on the pain scale. The pain is exacerbated during weight-bearing activities and is often associated with muscle cramps. The child's parents have also noticed a delay in motor milestones. Physical examination revealed genu varum, suggestive of long bone deformity. The patient's diet primarily consists of milk, with minimal intake of vitamin D-rich foods. Given the combination of symptoms, lifestyle factors, and clinical findings, nutritional rickets is highly suspected.",
  "Nutritional rickets_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 14-month-old infant, exclusively breastfed and born prematurely, was brought in for evaluation. The infant's mother has a history of vitamin D deficiency. The infant is irritable, and the parents have observed delayed dentition, with no teeth erupted at 9 months of age. There is also a widening of the wrists and delayed closure of the anterior fontanelle. In addition, the infant's weight-bearing capacity is limited, and the lower limbs exhibit a slight genu valgus deformity. These manifestations, along with the exclusive breastfeeding, maternal deficiency, and prematurity, raise a strong suspicion of nutritional rickets.",
  "Nutritional rickets_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 6-year-old child, with a dark skin tone, presented with aching pains in the legs, rated at 3/10, and occasional muscle cramps. The child's activity-related fatigue is notable, and there is a history of poor growth. Physical examination revealed frontal bossing and a widened costochondral junction, forming a rosary appearance. The patient's dietary history indicates a lack of vitamin D-rich foods, and the family resides in an area with limited sun exposure. Given the dark skin tone, lack of sunlight exposure, and the constellation of symptoms, nutritional rickets is a primary consideration, necessitating further diagnostic evaluation."
