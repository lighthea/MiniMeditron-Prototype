  "Perinatal Depression_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 26-year-old woman, a single parent with a low-income background, presented with a constellation of symptoms indicative of perinatal depression. She reported persistent feelings of profound sadness and hopelessness, often accompanied by frequent episodes of tearfulness. Additionally, she described elevated anxiety symptoms, with racing thoughts and a pervasive sense of unease regarding her ability to cope with parenting responsibilities. The patient's history documented a prior episode of depression, further complicating her current presentation. Notably, she disclosed recent experiences of intimate partner violence, which have contributed to her psychological distress. These symptoms have persisted for several weeks and have a significant impact on her daily functioning. Given the contextual factors and the presence of depressive and anxiety symptoms that do not reach the diagnostic threshold, a comprehensive assessment is crucial to evaluate the severity of her condition and formulate an appropriate intervention plan.",
  "Perinatal Depression_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 20-year-old primigravida, with a history of significant negative life events, including the loss of a close family member, presented with concerning symptoms suggestive of perinatal depression. She reported a pervasive and persistent low mood, coupled with feelings of worthlessness and guilt, which she attributed to her inability to cope with the demands of impending motherhood. The patient's anxiety symptoms were notably elevated, as she frequently experienced panic attacks and intrusive worries about her baby's health and her capability as a mother. Her lack of familial support, combined with the stress of adolescent parenthood, further exacerbated her emotional distress. Despite not meeting the diagnostic threshold for major depressive disorder, her symptoms have been enduring and are adversely affecting her overall well-being. A comprehensive evaluation is imperative to assess the severity of her condition and initiate timely interventions to mitigate the risk to both the patient and her unborn child.",
  "Perinatal Depression_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 32-year-old woman, currently in her second trimester of pregnancy, presented with a complex profile of depressive and anxiety symptoms, indicative of perinatal depression. She had a documented history of depression, which had been effectively managed with cognitive-behavioral therapy in the past. However, her current presentation was notable for a resurgence of depressive symptoms, including persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness, as well as a pervasive sense of anxiety and impending doom. The patient's low-income status and recent intimate partner violence further compounded her psychological distress. Despite her proactive efforts to seek therapy, her symptoms continued to escalate, presenting a diagnostic challenge as they did not meet the threshold for a formal depressive disorder. Given her history and the presence of significant contextual factors, a comprehensive assessment is essential to evaluate the severity of her condition and tailor an intervention plan that may incorporate her previous successful treatment modalities."
