  "Polycystic kidney disease (PKD)_1": "Patient A, a 40-year-old male, presents with a complex medical history characterized by uncontrolled hypertension, recurring episodes of severe back pain (rated 7/10 on the pain scale), and intermittent hematuria. Notably, he reports a persistent feeling of abdominal fullness, and an observable increase in abdominal girth due to enlarged kidneys. Family history analysis reveals a strong hereditary link to kidney disorders. Despite antihypertensive medication, his blood pressure remains elevated. The constellation of symptoms, coupled with the presence of PKD in the family history, underscores the pressing need for a comprehensive diagnostic workup to elucidate the etiology of his clinical presentation.",
  "Polycystic kidney disease (PKD)_2": "Patient B, a 30-year-old female, with a pertinent family history of PKD, seeks medical evaluation for chronic dull back pain and occasional episodes of hematuria. She describes the pain as persistent, with a severity rating of 5/10. Additionally, she reports recurrent headaches and a palpable increase in the size of her abdomen, indicative of enlarged kidneys. Nocturia and a history of kidney stones further compound her clinical presentation. Given her family history and the onset of symptoms at a relatively young age, there is a strong suspicion for PKD. A comprehensive diagnostic assessment is imperative to confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate management strategies.",
  "Polycystic kidney disease (PKD)_3": "A 50-year-old male patient, Patient C, with no prior medical history, presents with elevated blood pressure refractory to multiple antihypertensive agents. He reports chronic back pain, which he rates at 6/10 in intensity, and recurrent episodes of hematuria. Physical examination reveals an increased abdominal size due to enlarged kidneys, and he has been experiencing a persistent feeling of abdominal fullness. The presence of kidney stones and a recent history of urinary tract infections further adds to his clinical picture. While there is no known family history of PKD, the age at which symptoms have manifested, in conjunction with the observed presentation, necessitates a comprehensive diagnostic workup to ascertain the underlying cause of his condition."
