  "Soft tissue sarcoma_1": "Case 1:\nA 45-year-old male patient, with no significant medical history, presented with a palpable lump in his left thigh. The patient described the pain associated with the lump as intermittent and rated it as 4 out of 10 on the pain scale. Physical examination revealed a noticeable swelling in the thigh region. The pain was exacerbated when the patient performed physical activities or when pressure was applied to the area. Given the patient's age and the atypical nature of the lump, further diagnostic investigation is warranted to rule out soft tissue sarcoma, especially considering the diverse cell origins associated with this condition.",
  "Soft tissue sarcoma_2": "Case 2:\nA 55-year-old female patient, with a history of breast cancer treated five years ago, reported a new lump in her upper arm. The patient described the pain associated with the lump as persistent, with a severity rating of 6 out of 10. Physical examination revealed a noticeable swelling in the affected arm. The patient also reported pain and discomfort, which radiated along the arm and was exacerbated by movement. Given the history of breast cancer, the appearance of a new lump in the soft tissue, and the elevated pain levels, the diagnostic evaluation should prioritize ruling out a soft tissue sarcoma, taking into account the potential for different cell origins in this context.",
  "Soft tissue sarcoma_3": "Case 3:\nA 50-year-old male patient, with a history of radiation therapy for a previous cancer, presented with a palpable lump in his lower back. The patient described the pain associated with the lump as sporadic, with a pain score of 3 out of 10. Physical examination revealed a noticeable swelling in the lower back area. The patient reported occasional discomfort and pain, which he attributed to the lump. Given the history of radiation therapy and the presence of a new lump in the soft tissue, it is crucial to consider the possibility of soft tissue sarcoma in the diagnostic workup, as the condition can be challenging to discern from other types of growths, especially in patients with a history of cancer treatment."
