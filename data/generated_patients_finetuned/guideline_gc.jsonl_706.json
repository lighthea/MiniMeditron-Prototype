  "Central Venous Access Device Infections_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 38-year-old male with a complex medical history, including long-term home parenteral nutrition (HPN), presents with localized erythema, tenderness, and purulent discharge at the site of his triple-lumen central venous access device (CVAD). The patient reports a moderate, constant pain (6/10) at the CVAD insertion site, which has been persisting for five days. Despite meticulous care provided by his trained caregiver, the symptoms have not improved. The duration of HPN and the multi-lumen nature of the CVAD further complicate the diagnostic process. Given the patient's reliance on HPN, prompt and accurate identification of the underlying cause is crucial to guide appropriate management.",
  "Central Venous Access Device Infections_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 55-year-old female patient, who has been dependent on home parenteral nutrition (HPN) for the past seven months, is seen in the clinic for evaluation of her central venous access device (CVAD). She reports recurrent episodes of fever (38.5\u00b0C), chills, and general malaise, which she attributes to her underlying condition. On examination, the CVAD insertion site appears inflamed, and the patient experiences mild tenderness (3/10) in the surrounding area. The type and duration of HPN, coupled with the patient's symptoms, pose challenges in diagnosing the precise nature of the CVAD-related issue. Despite the patient's adherence to care protocols, the symptoms and systemic manifestations persist, necessitating a comprehensive assessment.",
  "Central Venous Access Device Infections_3": "    Patient Description 3:\n    A 45-year-old male with a history of chronic intestinal failure requiring home parenteral nutrition (HPN) presents with intermittent fever, night sweats, and a feeling of fatigue. He also describes a new-onset throbbing pain (5/10) at the site of his double-lumen central venous access device (CVAD), which has been troubling him for the past two weeks. The patient has diligently followed the care regimen, but the localized symptoms have worsened, prompting this evaluation. The specific challenges in diagnosing CVAD-related infections, given the duration of HPN and the characteristics of the CVAD, necessitate a comprehensive approach to address the patient's clinical presentation."
