  "Quetiapine Poisoning_1": "    Patient A, a 28-year-old female with a history of psychiatric illness and recent prescription of quetiapine, was brought to the emergency department after an intentional overdose. She presented with pronounced CNS depression, exhibiting a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8. Additionally, the patient displayed tachycardia with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute and hypotension with a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg. The presence of co-ingestants and the observed dose raise concerns about quetiapine poisoning. Immediate medical intervention is crucial to address the overdose and stabilize the patient's condition.",
  "Quetiapine Poisoning_2": "    Patient B, a 35-year-old male with no known medical history, was found unconscious at home. Upon arrival at the emergency department, he exhibited severe CNS depression, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 6. Furthermore, the patient's presentation included tachycardia, with a heart rate of 120 beats per minute, and hypotension, with a blood pressure reading of 80/50 mmHg. There is a strong suspicion of intentional overdose, given the absence of a medical history consistent with quetiapine use and the observed clinical symptoms. The presence of co-ingestants is also a pertinent factor in the diagnostic assessment of this poisoning case.",
  "Quetiapine Poisoning_3": "    Patient C, a 40-year-old male, was brought to the emergency department after a witnessed ingestion of quetiapine tablets. He displayed CNS depression, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 10, along with tachycardia (heart rate: 100 beats per minute) and hypotension (blood pressure: 88/58 mmHg). The intentional nature of the ingestion, as well as the reported dose, point towards quetiapine poisoning as the likely diagnosis. The absence of a documented history of quetiapine prescription or use further supports this assessment. A comprehensive management plan is imperative to address the toxic effects of quetiapine in this patient."
