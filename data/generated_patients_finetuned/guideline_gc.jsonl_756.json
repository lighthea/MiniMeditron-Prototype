  "Head and Neck Cancer Survivorship_1": "Patient A is a 62-year-old male with a history of successfully treated head and neck cancer, presenting with concerning symptoms. He describes persistent, localized pain in the oropharyngeal region, radiating to the right ear, which he rates as 5/10 on the pain scale. In addition, he reports an intermittent sore throat and difficulty in swallowing solid foods. Clinical examination reveals subtle changes in his voice quality.

She reports a sensation of dryness and a persistent, non-specific discomfort in her throat, rated at 6/10 in terms of severity. She has noticed hoarseness in her voice and occasional difficulty in articulating certain sounds. These symptoms have been impacting her quality of life. A comprehensive review of her individualized follow-up plan with the treating team is essential to address the late effects she is experiencing and to explore potential interventions to alleviate her discomfort.",
  "Head and Neck Cancer Survivorship_3": "A 50-year-old male, Patient C, who underwent treatment for head and neck cancer, is being monitored as part of his survivorship care. He presents with new-onset, dull throbbing pain in the cervical region, which he rates as 4/10 in intensity. The pain is associated with occasional paresthesia in the right shoulder and arm. Given his history of head and neck cancer and the presence of distant recurrences in this population, a thorough assessment, including imaging studies, is warranted to investigate the underlying etiology of his symptoms. It is essential to incorporate his smoking history into the evaluation and follow an individualized follow-up plan to guide further management."
