  "Immunotherapy-induced Adverse Events_1": " 1. Patient Description:\nA 58-year-old male with a history of advanced melanoma presented with a constellation of symptoms following the initiation of immunotherapy. The most prominent complaint is severe fatigue (rated 7/10) that has persisted for the past three weeks, significantly impacting his daily activities. Additionally, he developed a diffuse rash, characterized by erythematous papules and vesicles, covering approximately 30% of his body surface area. The rash is pruritic but has not shown signs of improvement with over-the-counter topical treatments. The patient reports frequent, watery diarrhea (4-6 episodes daily) and mild abdominal cramping. He denies any history of gastrointestinal disorders. These symptoms began approximately four days after the first immunotherapy infusion. Given the timing of onset, the nature, and severity of these multi-system symptoms, a thorough evaluation for immunotherapy-induced adverse events is warranted.",
  "Immunotherapy-induced Adverse Events_2": "2. Patient Description:\nA 45-year-old female with a diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma has experienced a complex array of symptoms following the initiation of immunotherapy. She reported persistent nausea and recurrent episodes of vomiting (2-3 times per day) for the past two weeks, with associated anorexia leading to a weight loss of 5% of her baseline body weight. The patient described a generalized feeling of unwellness and noted the onset of a pruritic, erythematous rash on her trunk and extremities. Furthermore, she developed intermittent, colicky abdominal pain and has experienced loose stools, indicative of diarrhea, for the last ten days. An evaluation revealed elevated liver enzymes, with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels three times the upper limit of normal. Given the timing of symptom onset in relation to the initiation of immunotherapy, along with the severity and nature of the presenting symptoms, an assessment for immunotherapy-induced adverse events, particularly hepatitis, is paramount.",
  "Immunotherapy-induced Adverse Events_3": "3. Patient Description:\nA 62-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma presented with an assortment of symptoms that began shortly after starting immunotherapy. He described a persistent, non-pruritic rash, mainly distributed on sun-exposed areas, which has been present for the last four weeks. In addition, the patient reported a gradual onset of joint pain, swelling, and morning stiffness in multiple large joints, significantly impacting his mobility. The pain, rated as 6/10, is not adequately controlled with over-the-counter analgesics. Furthermore, he experienced increasing fatigue and muscle weakness, with an unintentional weight loss of 10 pounds over the last month. An evaluation revealed elevated creatine kinase levels. The combination of dermatologic, musculoskeletal, and systemic manifestations, along with the temporal relationship to immunotherapy initiation, necessitates a comprehensive assessment for immunotherapy-induced adverse events, including dermatitis, arthritis, and myositis."
