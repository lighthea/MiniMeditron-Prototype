  "Native Vertebral Osteomyelitis in Adults_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 56-year-old male, with a history of recent S. aureus bloodstream infection, presented with a new, persistent localized back pain in the lumbar region. The pain is described as severe (7/10) and has been escalating over the past two weeks. He also reported intermittent low-grade fever. Laboratory tests revealed elevated inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP). The patient's clinical presentation, coupled with the recent S. aureus bloodstream infection, raises concerns for native vertebral osteomyelitis. Given the persistence of symptoms and the history of S. aureus infection, further diagnostic work-up, including imaging studies and a targeted biopsy, is imperative for a definitive diagnosis.",
  "Native Vertebral Osteomyelitis in Adults_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 42-year-old female, residing in an endemic area for brucellosis, presented with a two-week history of new-onset neck pain, rated at 5/10 in intensity, which has been localized and progressively worsening. She also reported episodes of fever. Physical examination revealed limited neck movement. Laboratory investigations demonstrated elevated ESR and CRP levels. The patient's context of residing in a brucellosis-endemic area, coupled with the presence of fever, neck pain, and elevated inflammatory markers, raises a strong suspicion for native vertebral osteomyelitis. Given the regional endemicity and the concerning clinical presentation, further diagnostic assessment, including imaging studies and potential brucellosis serology, is warranted.",
  "Native Vertebral Osteomyelitis in Adults_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 64-year-old male with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus and previous vertebral surgery, presented with a six-week history of fluctuating back pain in the thoracic region, rated at 6/10 in severity. The pain was associated with intermittent low-grade fevers. Despite an initial course of broad-spectrum antibiotics, the symptoms persisted. Laboratory studies revealed elevated ESR and CRP. The patient also experienced new neurologic symptoms, characterized by radicular pain and sensory disturbances in the lower extremities. His history of diabetes and prior vertebral surgery, along with the prolonged and unrelenting nature of symptoms, raises concern for native vertebral osteomyelitis. Given the treatment resistance and the evolution of neurologic symptoms, a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including advanced imaging and neurosurgical consultation, is imperative to guide further management."
