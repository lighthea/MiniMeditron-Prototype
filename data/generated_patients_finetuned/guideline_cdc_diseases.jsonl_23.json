  "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)_1": "    Case Description 1:\n    A 62-year-old male patient with a history of diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presented with a persistent fever of 101\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), accompanied by a dry cough and increasing shortness of breath. The fever, cough, and dyspnea have been ongoing for the past 10 days and are currently causing moderate discomfort, with a pain level of 4 on a scale of 0 to 10. Additionally, the patient reported episodes of diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Given the contextual factors of age, diabetes, and COPD, the presence of these symptoms raises concerns that necessitate a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.",
  "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)_2": "    Case Description 2:\n    A 57-year-old female patient, known to have heart disease, presented with a high-grade fever (103.5\u00b0F/39.7\u00b0C) persisting for five days, associated with a productive cough and severe shortness of breath. The patient's respiratory symptoms have rapidly worsened, leading to significant respiratory distress with a pain level of 8 on a scale of 0 to 10. She also reported episodes of nausea. Given the patient's underlying heart disease and the severity of her respiratory symptoms, an urgent assessment is crucial to determine the underlying cause and initiate appropriate management.",
  "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)_3": "    Case Description 3:\n    A 45-year-old male patient with a recent history of cancer, undergoing chemotherapy, reported a persistent low-grade fever and cough for the past two weeks. He described the cough as productive, with occasional episodes of vomiting and diarrhea. The patient's fever, while not high, has been disruptive, with a pain level of 3 on a scale of 0 to 10. Considering the contextual factor of the patient's ongoing cancer treatment, the presence of these symptoms requires a thorough evaluation to elucidate the etiology and guide further management, taking into account the immunocompromised state due to chemotherapy."
