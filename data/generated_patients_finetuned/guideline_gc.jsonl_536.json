  "Advanced Prostate Cancer_1": "    Patient description 1:\n    A 65-year-old male with a relevant medical history presented with a gradually increasing serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, now at 55 ng/mL. He has been experiencing persistent, dull bone pain in the lower back and pelvis, which he rates at 5/10 in intensity. The pain has been affecting his daily activities, and he has not observed any significant relief with over-the-counter pain medications. Given the combination of elevated PSA levels and the characteristic bone pain, there is a high clinical suspicion for metastatic involvement. Conventional bone imaging is essential for further evaluation due to its impact on diagnostic sensitivity in this context.",
  "Advanced Prostate Cancer_2": "    Patient description 2:\n    A 72-year-old male, previously diagnosed with prostate cancer, presented with a rising serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, which is currently at 70 ng/mL. He reported persistent bone pain, primarily in the lumbar spine and hips, with an intensity rating of 6/10, adversely affecting his quality of life and mobility. Despite ongoing androgen deprivation therapy, the progression of PSA levels, coupled with the bone pain, raises concerns regarding metastatic disease involving the bone and lymph nodes. Given his history and the characteristic clinical presentation, further assessment using conventional bone imaging is imperative for treatment planning.",
  "Advanced Prostate Cancer_3": "    Patient description 3:\n    A 68-year-old male, never previously diagnosed with prostate cancer, presented with a markedly elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 80 ng/mL. He described a chronic, bothersome bone pain located in the ribs and upper thoracic spine, with a pain intensity rating of 7/10, impacting his ability to perform daily tasks and sleep comfortably. The persistence and nature of bone pain, along with the extremely elevated PSA level, raise significant concerns for metastatic disease involving the bone and lymph nodes. Conventional bone imaging is crucial for accurate staging and treatment decision-making in this scenario."
