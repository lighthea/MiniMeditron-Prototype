  "Meningioma_1": "    Patient A, a 45-year-old male, presents with a complex set of symptoms. He reports persistent and worsening headaches, which he rates as 7/10 in intensity, with morning exacerbations. These headaches are accompanied by changes in vision, including intermittent blurriness and double vision. Additionally, he has been experiencing episodes of memory loss and has noticed a gradual loss of smell. Neurological examination reveals a subtle weakness in his left arm. The presence of these symptoms, particularly in a male of this age, raises concerns for an underlying neurologic condition. Further diagnostic evaluation is warranted to elucidate the etiology of his presentation.",

Alongside these headaches, she has noticed changes in her vision, including blurriness and double vision. Additionally, she reports intermittent hearing loss and ringing in her ears. Neurological examination reveals a subtle language difficulty and mild weakness in her legs. Given the presence of these symptoms in a female patient of her age, urgent diagnostic investigations are necessary to determine the underlying cause of her condition.",
