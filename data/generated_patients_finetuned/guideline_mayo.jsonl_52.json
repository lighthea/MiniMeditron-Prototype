  "Angelman syndrome_1": "    Patient A, a 4-year-old child, was brought in by the parents with a complex set of symptoms. The child has been experiencing delayed development, especially in speech and motor skills. They have not yet achieved the milestone of speaking more than a few words or balancing well while walking. Additionally, the child's history is notable for seizures that commenced at the age of 2, further complicating the clinical picture. Physical examination revealed a happy and excitable personality, along with frequent smiling and laughter. The presence of intellectual disability is evident, and the child exhibits difficulty in going to sleep and staying asleep. These observations, coupled with the onset of seizures at the specified age range, raise strong suspicion for an underlying genetic condition and necessitate a comprehensive diagnostic workup.",
  "Angelman syndrome_2": "    Patient B, a 6-year-old with a history of developmental delays, was referred for further evaluation. The child has had trouble with speech and balance, along with intellectual disability. The parents reported that there was no crawling or babbling during the 6 to 12 months age range. The patient's speech remains minimal, and they struggle with walking, moving, and balancing. A distinctive feature noted is the frequent smiling and laughter, which is characteristic of the child's happy and excitable personality. Furthermore, the child experiences issues with feeding and sleeping, adding to the complexity of their clinical presentation. Given these symptoms, along with the developmental timeline and the observed genetic mutation affecting the UBE3A gene, an in-depth diagnostic assessment is imperative to determine the underlying etiology of the patient's condition.",
  "Angelman syndrome_3": "    Patient C, a 5-year-old with a background of complex medical issues, presented with a constellation of symptoms. The child's developmental delays, particularly in speech and motor skills, have been a recurring concern. They exhibit delayed speech, minimal speech output, and difficulties in walking, moving, and balancing well. Notably, the patient's history is marked by seizures that commenced at 3 years of age. On examination, the child's demeanor is characterized by frequent smiling, laughter, and an overall happy disposition. Sucking and feeding difficulties, as well as trouble with sleep, further contribute to the clinical picture. Additionally, the presence of a genetic mutation on the UBE3A gene adds a crucial diagnostic factor. The observed symptoms, in conjunction with the specified age of seizure onset and genetic predisposition, underscore the need for a comprehensive diagnostic workup to elucidate the underlying condition."
