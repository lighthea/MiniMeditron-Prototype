  "Ovarian cysts_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 35-year-old female patient with a history of irregular menstrual cycles presented with recurring pelvic pain, which she described as a dull ache (rated 4/10 in intensity) that is often accompanied by a feeling of fullness and bloating in her lower abdomen. These symptoms have persisted for the last six months and have recently become more pronounced. On two occasions in the past month, she experienced sudden, severe abdominal pain (rated 8/10) associated with vomiting and a low-grade fever. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the pelvic region. Given the patient's history of menstrual irregularities and the presence of both chronic and acute pelvic pain, further investigations, including pelvic ultrasound and tumor marker tests, are warranted to assess the size and nature of the cyst and determine an appropriate course of action.",
  "Ovarian cysts_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 40-year-old female patient, gravida 2, para 2, presented with a two-month history of intermittent pelvic pain and bloating. She described the pelvic pain as a dull, persistent sensation (rated 3/10) and reported a constant feeling of fullness and pressure in her abdomen. The symptoms have been affecting her daily activities and are more noticeable before and during her menstrual periods. The patient's medical history is unremarkable, and she has regular menstrual cycles. Physical examination and pelvic ultrasound are indicated to evaluate the presence, size, and composition of the ovarian cyst, considering the persistent nature of the symptoms and their association with the menstrual cycle.",
  "Ovarian cysts_3": "    Patient Description 3:\n    An urgent care referral brought in a 50-year-old female patient who complained of sudden, severe abdominal and pelvic pain (rated 9/10) along with episodes of vomiting. She appeared lightheaded and exhibited cold, clammy skin, raising concerns about possible shock. The pain had an acute onset and was unlike any she had experienced before. The patient's medical history revealed no previous gynecological issues, and she had been postmenopausal for three years. The combination of sudden, severe pain, vomiting, and signs of shock necessitates immediate diagnostic intervention to identify the underlying cause, which may include pelvic ultrasound and tumor marker tests."
