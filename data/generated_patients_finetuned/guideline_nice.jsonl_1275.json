  "Bleeding oesophageal varices_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 52-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse presented with a severe episode of hematemesis, rating his pain at 8/10. The bleeding was profuse and persistent, necessitating multiple transfusions. The patient has a known medical history of cirrhosis, and clinical examination revealed signs of portal hypertension. Endoscopy confirmed the presence of bleeding oesophageal varices. The diagnostic process was significantly influenced by the coexistence of portal hypertension and cirrhosis, as well as the refractory nature of the bleeding.",

The patient described her abdominal pain as 7/10 in intensity. She had experienced multiple episodes of bleeding in the past, which had required medical intervention. On this occasion, the bleeding was attributed to oesophageal varices, as confirmed by endoscopy. The presence of cirrhosis, along with the history of refractory bleeding, significantly influenced the diagnostic process.",
