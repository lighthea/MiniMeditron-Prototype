  "Bile duct stones_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 45-year-old male patient, with a history of occasional epigastric discomfort, presented with recurrent episodes of upper abdominal pain. The pain, rated 6/10 in intensity, is characterized as a dull ache and often radiates to the right upper quadrant. He has also experienced intermittent episodes of jaundice. The patient's medical history is unremarkable, and he has not undergone any previous abdominal surgeries or interventions. Given the recurrent nature of his symptoms, along with the presence of jaundice, a comprehensive evaluation is warranted to determine the etiology of his upper abdominal discomfort and the underlying cause of his intermittent jaundice.",
  "Bile duct stones_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 55-year-old female patient sought medical attention for persistent upper abdominal pain, which she described as a sharp, cramping sensation with an intensity of 7/10. The pain is located in the right upper quadrant and often radiates to her right shoulder. She has a medical history of obesity and has experienced several similar, albeit less severe, episodes of abdominal pain in the past year. The pain is not alleviated by over-the-counter medications. Physical examination reveals mild jaundice. Given the intensity and persistence of her upper abdominal pain, further diagnostic assessment is necessary to elucidate the underlying cause and to guide appropriate management.",
  "Bile duct stones_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 60-year-old male patient with a history of alcohol use disorder presented with severe, episodic upper abdominal pain, which he described as a stabbing sensation with an intensity of 9/10. The pain is localized to the right upper quadrant and is associated with recurrent bouts of jaundice. The patient's medical history is notable for long-term alcohol abuse. Despite multiple attempts to manage his symptoms with analgesics, the pain has become increasingly debilitating. Physical examination confirms the presence of jaundice and right upper quadrant tenderness. Given the severity of his symptoms and the history of alcohol abuse, a comprehensive diagnostic workup is essential to identify the underlying cause of his recurrent, severe upper abdominal pain and jaundice."
