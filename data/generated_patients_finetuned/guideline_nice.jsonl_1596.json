  "Pulmonary vein stenosis in infants_1": "    Description 1:\n    A 6-month-old male infant, with a history of congenital cardiac abnormalities, was brought to the clinic by his parents. The patient is presenting with significant respiratory distress, characterized by severe and persistent coughing, tachypnea, and markedly decreased exercise tolerance. Auscultation reveals the presence of diffuse crackles and wheezing in the lung fields. The infant's oxygen saturation levels are consistently lower than normal. These symptoms are indicative of severe lung damage. Given the patient's history of congenital cardiac abnormalities, pulmonary vein stenosis is a significant concern and must be thoroughly evaluated.",
  "Pulmonary vein stenosis in infants_2": "    Description 2:\n    A 10-month-old female infant, who underwent surgical correction for congenital cardiac anomalies, is being evaluated in the clinic due to a concerning medical presentation. The infant's parents report a progressive onset of respiratory distress, with the child experiencing severe episodes of dyspnea and recurrent bronchospasm. Auscultation reveals persistent crackles and wheezing in the lung fields. The patient's oxygen saturation levels are consistently lower than optimal. These symptoms, coupled with the infant's history of cardiac surgery, raise a high index of suspicion for pulmonary vein stenosis, necessitating comprehensive diagnostic assessment.",
  "Pulmonary vein stenosis in infants_3": "    Description 3:\n    A 7-month-old male infant, with a known history of congenital cardiac abnormalities, has been brought to the clinic by his caregivers. The infant's medical presentation is characterized by marked respiratory distress, with severe and persistent cough, tachypnea, and significantly reduced exercise tolerance. Auscultation findings include widespread crackles and wheezing in the lung fields. The infant's oxygen saturation levels are consistently below the normal range. These symptoms, in the context of a pre-existing congenital cardiac condition, raise concerns about pulmonary vein stenosis. A thorough diagnostic evaluation is imperative to ascertain the underlying etiology of the severe lung damage observed in this patient."
