He reported persistent, aching joint and muscle pain, accompanied by chest discomfort exacerbated during breathing, which he rated as 6/10 on the pain scale. The patient described a profound sense of fatigue and recurrent flu-like manifestations, including fever, chills, and night sweats. Additionally, he experienced unexplained weight loss and noticed new-onset swelling in his lower extremities and abdomen. On auscultation, there was an abnormal, changed whooshing sound (murmur) in the heart. Physical examination revealed tenderness under the left rib cage (spleen), as well as painless red, purple, or brown skin lesions on the palms of his hands and the soles of his feet (Janeway lesions). The presence of these symptoms, coupled with the patient's history of intravenous drug use, highlights the complexity of the diagnostic process.",
