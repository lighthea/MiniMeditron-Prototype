  "Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome_2": "    A 34-year-old male patient, with a history of camping in rural areas, presents with a 5-day history of persistent fever (101-102\u00b0F) accompanied by severe muscle aches and headaches. He reports nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which have led to dehydration. The patient's cough has progressively worsened, and he is now experiencing significant difficulty breathing, rated 8/10 on the pain scale. On examination, he exhibits tachypnea and hypotension. Given his recent camping trip and the constellation of symptoms, including a rapid onset of respiratory distress, there is a strong suspicion of a zoonotic infection, necessitating further diagnostic workup to confirm the underlying etiology.",
  "Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome_4": "    A 42-year-old female patient, with a known history of exposure to rodent-infested environments, presents with an acute febrile illness. She describes persistent fever and chills, along with generalized muscle pain and abdominal discomfort. The patient reports recurrent episodes of vomiting and diarrhea, contributing to a sense of overall weakness. She has also developed a dry cough, which has now become more pronounced, accompanied by moderate difficulty in breathing, with pain levels rated at 5/10. Despite receiving supportive care, her symptoms have been progressively worsening over the past week. The patient's occupational and environmental history, coupled with the rapid onset and evolution of the illness, raises concerns regarding a potential zoonotic-related condition.",
  "Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome_6": "    A 28-year-old male patient, without significant medical history, presents with a 4-day history of high-grade fever, severe body aches, and persistent headaches. He has experienced nausea, stomach pain, and recurrent episodes of vomiting and diarrhea, leading to dehydration. The patient now reports a dry cough, associated with increasing difficulty in breathing, which he rates at 7/10 in terms of pain intensity. On examination, he exhibits signs of tachypnea and hypotension. The rapid onset and progression of the respiratory symptoms, in the setting of his recent outdoor activities, particularly in rodent-inhabited areas, prompt the consideration of a zoonotic infection as the likely cause of his presentation."
