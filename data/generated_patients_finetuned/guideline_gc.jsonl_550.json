  "Breast Cancer_1": " 1. A 45-year-old female patient presented with a palpable mass in her left breast, which she first noticed three months ago. The mass is painless, firm, and irregular in shape, measuring approximately 3 cm in diameter. The patient has no family history of breast cancer or any previous benign breast lumps. She describes occasional dull aching in her left breast, with a pain score of 3/10, which is not associated with her menstrual cycle. There are no nipple discharge, skin changes, or axillary lymphadenopathy. The patient has not undergone any prior breast imaging or biopsy. Mammography and ultrasound are indicated to further evaluate the suspicious breast mass.",
  "Breast Cancer_2": "2. A 50-year-old woman with a history of hormonal replacement therapy presented with persistent breast pain localized to her right breast, which she rated as 5/10 in intensity. The pain has been ongoing for the past six months and is not clearly associated with her menstrual cycle. She denies any palpable breast lumps but reports mild nipple discharge, which is serous in nature. The patient has no family history of breast cancer. Physical examination revealed no skin changes or lymphadenopathy. Given her symptoms and hormonal therapy history, a diagnostic mammogram and breast ultrasound are warranted to assess the underlying cause of the breast pain and nipple discharge.",
  "Breast Cancer_3": "3. A 55-year-old female patient, who is a known carrier of the BRCA1 gene mutation, presented for her routine breast cancer screening. She reported no breast symptoms but had a strong family history of breast cancer, with multiple first-degree relatives affected. The patient's sister was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 48. Given the high risk associated with her genetic mutation and family history, a comprehensive breast cancer screening program is recommended, including annual mammography and breast MRI. The goal is to detect any potential malignancy at an early, more treatable stage."
