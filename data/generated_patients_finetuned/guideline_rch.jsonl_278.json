  "Menstrual Management in Adolescents with Disabilities_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 14-year-old adolescent with a history of developmental disabilities presents with challenges in hygiene during her menstrual cycle, often leading to skin irritation and discomfort in the perineal area. Her caregivers have noticed behavioural changes and occasional episodes of aggression during this time. The patient's medical history is significant for obesity and malabsorption issues. She experiences heavy, irregular bleeding, which is associated with severe menstrual pain, rated as 7/10 on the pain scale. These symptoms have led to a cyclical exacerbation of her underlying medical conditions, including increased difficulty with mobility and self-care. The time since the onset of her secondary sexual characteristics is 18 months. Given the complex nature of her medical history and the observed symptoms, a comprehensive assessment is warranted to guide appropriate menstrual management.",
  "Menstrual Management in Adolescents with Disabilities_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 16-year-old adolescent with multiple disabilities is referred for evaluation of her menstrual issues. She has a history of recurrent venous thromboembolism in her family. The patient experiences heavy and irregular menstrual bleeding, which is often accompanied by severe pain, rated at 8/10, during her cycles. The bleeding episodes exacerbate her underlying medical conditions, leading to increased respiratory distress and fatigue. Her menstrual hygiene is challenging, and she has a history of behavioural changes during her periods. The duration and regularity of her bleeding episodes, along with the associated physical and emotional symptoms, require close assessment in the context of her family history of thromboembolism and medical complexity.",
  "Menstrual Management in Adolescents with Disabilities_3": "    Patient Description 3:\n    An 15-year-old adolescent girl with cerebral palsy and a history of swallowing difficulty presents with menstrual management challenges. She experiences heavy, irregular menstrual bleeding, often associated with abdominal pain rated at 6/10 in intensity. The patient's medical history is notable for recurrent arterial thromboembolism in her family. Her menstrual cycles exacerbate her medical conditions, leading to increased spasticity and irritability. Additionally, her swallowing difficulty and malabsorption issues pose further complexities in managing her menstrual symptoms. A comprehensive assessment is crucial, considering the patient's medical history, family history of arterial thromboembolism, and the impact of her menstrual cycles on her overall well-being."
