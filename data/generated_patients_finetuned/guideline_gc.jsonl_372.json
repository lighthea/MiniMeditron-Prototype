  "Venous Thromboembolism_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 45-year-old female patient, who leads a predominantly sedentary lifestyle working in an office, presented with a moderate level of pain in her right lower extremity. The pain has persisted for the past week and is accompanied by swelling and localized warmth in the affected leg. She has no history of trauma or recent surgery. The patient's D-dimer test returned positive, prompting the need for further evaluation. Given her clinical presentation and the positive D-dimer result, a duplex ultrasound is indicated to assess the presence of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The contextual information regarding diagnostic factors, notably the effects of ultrasound on clinical outcomes and diagnostic accuracy studies, supports the utilization of duplex ultrasound in this scenario.",
  "Venous Thromboembolism_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 62-year-old male patient, with a history of smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), reported sudden-onset pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath of high intensity, which he describes as 8/10 on the pain scale. The onset of these symptoms was acute, and the patient's medical history is significant for previous episodes of DVT. His D-dimer test is positive, and the pretest probability of pulmonary embolism (PE) is high, given the clinical context and the patient's risk factors. In this high-prevalence setting, computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the recommended modality for assessing the suspected PE, as supported by the contextual information regarding diagnostic factors, including the effects of CTPA on clinical outcomes and its diagnostic accuracy studies.",
  "Venous Thromboembolism_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 35-year-old female patient, who recently underwent major orthopedic surgery, presented with swelling and tenderness in her left upper extremity. The pain is described as mild to moderate and has been persistent for the past few days. The patient's medical history is notable for the use of oral contraceptives. A D-dimer test was performed and returned positive, prompting the need for further evaluation of upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Given the clinical presentation, the patient's history of recent surgery, and the positive D-dimer result, a duplex ultrasound is indicated to assess the presence of upper extremity DVT. The contextual information regarding diagnostic factors supports the use of duplex ultrasound in this scenario, particularly in a population with a high pretest probability (likely PTP)."
