The pain was often accompanied by a feeling of fatigue and a decreased appetite, leading to unintentional weight loss. The patient's occupational history is notable, and the presence of known liver disease further complicates the diagnostic process. Laboratory tests showed elevated liver enzyme levels, prompting a more comprehensive evaluation of his condition."
