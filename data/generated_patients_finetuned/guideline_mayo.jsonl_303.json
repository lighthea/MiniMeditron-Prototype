  "Diabetic ketoacidosis_1": "Description 1:\nA 32-year-old male patient with a known history of type 1 diabetes mellitus presented to the clinic with concerning symptoms. The patient reported a persistent high level of thirst and increased urination frequency, coupled with recurrent episodes of vomiting and stomach pain. He described his overall condition as weak and tiring, with a sense of breathlessness. On examination, the patient displayed fruity-scented breath and appeared confused. Laboratory tests revealed markedly elevated blood sugar and ketone levels in the urine. The patient's medical history is significant for occasional non-compliance with insulin therapy. Given the constellation of symptoms and the contextual factors, including insulin non-adherence, the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis is highly probable.",
  "Diabetic ketoacidosis_2": "Description 2:\nA 25-year-old female patient, previously diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus, presented to the emergency department with a complex clinical picture. She reported intense thirst, frequent urination, and recurrent episodes of vomiting associated with abdominal pain. The patient expressed feelings of weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Notably, her breath exhibited a fruity odor, and she appeared confused during the initial assessment. Laboratory investigations demonstrated a markedly elevated blood sugar level and the presence of high ketone levels in the urine. The patient has a history of erratic insulin adherence and recent emotional trauma. These contextual factors, along with the observed symptoms, strongly support the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis.",
  "Diabetic ketoacidosis_3": "Description 3:\nIn the outpatient setting, a 40-year-old male patient, known to have type 2 diabetes, presented with troubling symptoms. He complained of persistent thirst, frequent urination, and recurrent episodes of vomiting, accompanied by stomach pain. The patient described his overall condition as weak and fatigued, with a notable sensation of breathlessness. Clinical examination revealed fruity-scented breath and a state of confusion. Laboratory tests confirmed a significantly elevated blood sugar level and the presence of high ketone levels in the urine. The patient has a history of irregular adherence to his oral anti-diabetic medications and a recent upper respiratory tract infection. These contextual elements, combined with the observed symptoms, are highly indicative of diabetic ketoacidosis."
