  "Intrinsic Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders_2": "    A 55-year-old male patient with a long-standing history of depression presented with a perplexing sleep pattern. He reported consistent difficulty in maintaining sleep at conventional times, with a notable pattern of early evening sleep onset (around 7:00 pm) and early morning awakening (around 3:00 am). Despite spending adequate time in bed, the patient expressed frustration due to his inability to achieve restorative sleep during these atypical hours. His depressive symptoms have been closely monitored and are currently in remission with ongoing psychotherapy and pharmacological management. The presence of depression, in conjunction with the patient's age, underscores the complex nature of his intrinsic circadian rhythm disturbance.",
  "Intrinsic Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders_4": "    A 19-year-old female college student presented with a prolonged history of sleep irregularities, which have significantly impacted her academic performance and daytime functioning. The patient reported a consistent delay in the timing of her sleep onset, often not feeling sleepy until the early hours of the morning (approximately 4:00 am). Consequently, she experienced difficulty awakening at socially conventional times, leading to chronic sleep deprivation. Despite employing various sleep hygiene measures and relaxation techniques, her delayed sleep-wake pattern persisted. The absence of any underlying psychiatric or medical comorbidities, coupled with the patient's young age, points towards a delayed sleep-wake phase disorder as the likely culprit.",
  "Intrinsic Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders_6": "    An 80-year-old male patient, residing in a long-term care facility, was referred for evaluation of his disturbed sleep pattern. The patient, who has a documented history of dementia, exhibited a fragmented sleep-wake cycle characterized by multiple naps and nighttime awakenings. He typically napped for short intervals throughout the day and night, often leading to a total daily sleep duration that was markedly different from the 24-hour norm. Caregivers reported that his nighttime awakenings were associated with confusion and disorientation. The presence of dementia, along with the observed irregular sleep-wake pattern, aligns with a diagnosis of irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder in this elderly individual. "
