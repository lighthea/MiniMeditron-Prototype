  "N2O toxicity_1": "    Patient A, a 32-year-old male, presented with a complex array of neurological symptoms, including altered sensation, sensory deficits, sensory ataxia, and muscle weakness, predominantly in the lower limbs. He reported a history of chronic substance misuse, specifically regular daily inhalation of higher doses of a certain agent for recreational purposes. The onset of symptoms has been progressively worsening over the past few months, accompanied by a notable personality change, irritability, and depression. Physical examination revealed reduced power and reflexes in the affected limbs, as well as gait disturbance and ataxia. Given the contextual information of regular daily misuse and the constellation of neurological manifestations, N2O toxicity is a significant consideration in this case.",
  "N2O toxicity_2": "    Patient B, a 25-year-old female, was brought to the emergency department following a fall at home, resulting in a short-lived episode of confusion. She reported a history of chronic misuse of a certain inhalant, often exceeding recommended daily limits for recreational purposes. On assessment, she exhibited hallucinations, ataxia, and altered sensation, as well as a gait disturbance and sensory deficits. Additionally, the patient displayed irritability and a noticeable personality change. These symptoms have been progressively worsening, mirroring the contextual information of chronic use and regular daily misuse. Given the history of inhalant misuse, the observed neurological manifestations, and the contextual information, N2O toxicity is a key diagnostic consideration in this case.",
  "N2O toxicity_3": "    Patient C, a 40-year-old male with a known history of substance abuse, presented with a range of concerning symptoms, including falls, muscle weakness, altered sensation, and sensory deficits, particularly in his lower limbs. He reported a pattern of chronic misuse of a specific inhalant, often in higher doses and exceeding recommended daily limits. The onset of symptoms has been insidiously progressive, accompanied by depression, irritability, and a pronounced gait disturbance. Physical examination revealed sensory ataxia, reduced power in the lower limbs, and diminished reflexes. Given the history of chronic inhalant misuse, the observed neurological manifestations, and the contextual information of regular daily misuse in higher doses, N2O toxicity is a significant consideration in this case."
