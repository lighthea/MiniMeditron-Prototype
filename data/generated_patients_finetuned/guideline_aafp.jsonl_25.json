  "Acute musculoskeletal pain_2": "2. Patient Description Two:\nA 45-year-old female patient, Ms. B, presented with acute musculoskeletal pain in her right knee. She reported that the pain developed suddenly following a misstep while descending a flight of stairs. Ms. B described the pain as throbbing and rated its intensity at 6/10, which is exacerbated during weight-bearing activities such as walking and climbing stairs. The patient has a history of intermittent knee pain, primarily associated with strenuous exercise, but this current pain is more severe and not responsive to her usual self-care measures, including rest and ice application. On examination, there is localized swelling and tenderness in the right knee joint, with mild limitation in range of motion. Ms. B's daily routine, which involves frequent walking, is significantly impacted by the persistent pain.",
  "Acute musculoskeletal pain_3": "3. Patient Description Three:\nA 30-year-old male patient, Mr. C, presented with an acute musculoskeletal pain complaint in his upper back. He reported that the pain onset was sudden, occurring after he lifted a heavy object at work. Mr. C described the pain as aching and rated it at 8/10 in intensity, which is constant and worsens with prolonged sitting or repetitive upper body movements. The patient's medical history is unremarkable for similar episodes of back pain. Despite using over-the-counter pain relievers and applying heat, the symptoms have not subsided.

He expresses a strong desire for an effective treatment to address his acute musculoskeletal pain."
