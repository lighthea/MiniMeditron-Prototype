  "COVID-19 pandemic resulted in inappropriate antibiotic use in adult hospitalized patients_1": "    Patient A, a 62-year-old male with no significant medical history, was admitted to the hospital with severe respiratory distress. He presented with high fever (101.8\u00b0F) persisting for five days, accompanied by a productive cough with purulent sputum. The patient reported sharp chest pain (7/10 on the pain scale) exacerbated by coughing. Clinical examination revealed coarse crackles in the lower lung fields. Initial laboratory findings showed elevated inflammatory markers. Despite the rapidly evolving information related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the presence of a bacterial coinfection in this setting raises concerns about inappropriate antibiotic use.",
  "COVID-19 pandemic resulted in inappropriate antibiotic use in adult hospitalized patients_2": "    Patient B, a 48-year-old female with a history of asthma, was hospitalized due to a severe illness characterized by fever, chills, and a productive cough with yellowish sputum. She described her chest pain as pleuritic, scoring 6/10 in intensity, and worsening with deep breathing. On auscultation, there were pronounced wheezes and rales throughout the lung fields. Laboratory tests indicated elevated inflammatory markers. Given the clinical and laboratory findings suggestive of bacterial coinfection in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of antibiotics warrants careful consideration.",
  "COVID-19 pandemic resulted in inappropriate antibiotic use in adult hospitalized patients_3": "    Patient C, a 70-year-old male, was admitted to the hospital with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. He had a prolonged fever, cough, and dyspnea, along with a new-onset confusion. The patient's chest pain, rated at 8/10 in severity, was described as sharp and stabbing, localized to the left hemithorax. Auscultation revealed diminished breath sounds and crackles in the affected area. Laboratory studies showed elevated inflammatory markers. Notably, the presence of a bacterial coinfection in other viral respiratory illnesses adds complexity to the diagnostic and treatment approach in this rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic scenario."
