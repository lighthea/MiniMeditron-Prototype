  "Ectopic pregnancy_1": " 1. A 29-year-old female patient, with a history of previous ectopic pregnancy, presented with a complex clinical picture. She reported a missed period, breast tenderness, and persistent nausea for the past three weeks. Additionally, she experienced light vaginal bleeding and recurrent episodes of pelvic pain, which she described as moderate in intensity (4/10 on the pain scale). Notably, the pain was occasionally radiating to her left shoulder. Upon examination, she exhibited extreme lightheadedness and had a fainting episode in the clinic. The patient's medical history was significant for tubal surgery due to a previous ectopic pregnancy. Given her complex presentation, the diagnostic process is further challenged by the contextual factors of her medical history and the increased risk posed by the tubal surgery.",
  "Ectopic pregnancy_2": "2. A 34-year-old woman, who had been undergoing fertility treatments for the past six months, sought medical attention for concerning symptoms. She reported a missed period, breast tenderness, and persistent nausea. The patient also described episodes of light vaginal bleeding, accompanied by pelvic pain rated at 6/10 in intensity. The pelvic pain was associated with shoulder pain, further complicating her clinical presentation. Her medical history was significant for fertility treatments, which are known to impact the diagnostic process for her current condition. These contextual factors, along with her symptoms, raise the index of suspicion for a specific diagnosis.",
  "Ectopic pregnancy_3": "3. A 26-year-old female patient, who is a smoker and had a recent history of pelvic inflammatory disease, presented with a challenging clinical scenario. She reported a missed period, breast tenderness, and frequent nausea. The patient also experienced light vaginal bleeding and severe pelvic pain, which she described as 8/10 in intensity. The pain was accompanied by shoulder pain. Furthermore, she exhibited extreme lightheadedness and had a fainting episode in the clinic. Given her history of pelvic inflammatory disease and smoking, along with the severity of her symptoms, the diagnostic process is notably influenced by these contextual factors."
