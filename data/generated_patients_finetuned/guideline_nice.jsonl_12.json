  "Acute cholecystitis_1": "    Patient A, a 45-year-old female, presents with a chief complaint of persistent, severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain, which she describes as sharp and cramp-like, with a pain level of 8/10. The pain started two days ago and is associated with nausea and several episodes of non-bilious vomiting. She also reported a subjective fever. The patient's medical history is significant for gallstone disease, which was diagnosed five years ago but was managed conservatively. There is no history of major surgeries or serious injuries. On examination, the patient exhibits tenderness and guarding over the right upper quadrant. Given the presence of gallstones in her medical history and the constellation of symptoms, acute cholecystitis is highly suspected.",
  "Acute cholecystitis_2": "    Patient B, a 60-year-old male, is admitted with a two-day history of right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The pain is constant, with a dull ache and is rated at 6/10 in intensity. He reports associated nausea but no vomiting. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes and is on oral hypoglycemic agents. On examination, there is tenderness in the right upper quadrant, and the patient has a low-grade fever. His blood glucose levels are within the target range. The absence of vomiting and milder pain, coupled with the presence of diabetes, adds complexity to the diagnostic process; however, acute cholecystitis remains a significant consideration given the clinical presentation.",
  "Acute cholecystitis_3": "    Patient C, a 30-year-old male, presents to the emergency department with sudden-onset severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain, which he describes as stabbing and cramping, with a pain score of 9/10. The pain started yesterday and is accompanied by frequent episodes of bilious vomiting. He denies any history of gallstone disease or major surgeries. The patient's temperature is elevated. There is no significant past medical history or comorbidities. On examination, he exhibits marked tenderness, guarding, and rebound tenderness in the right upper quadrant. The presence of severe pain, bilious vomiting, and the absence of a prior history of gallstone disease or other comorbidities poses a diagnostic challenge, but acute cholecystitis is a primary concern given the clinical presentation."
