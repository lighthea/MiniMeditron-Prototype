The patient's pre-pregnancy weight was within the normal range, and she has no history of prediabetes or gestational diabetes. Notably, there is no family history of diabetes.

Of note, the patient had a history of polycystic ovary syndrome before her pregnancy. She also reported a family history of diabetes, further raising her risk profile. These symptoms, in the context of her medical history and risk factors, warranted an assessment for gestational diabetes.",
  "Gestational diabetes_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 31-year-old pregnant woman in her 26th week of gestation reported troublesome symptoms during her prenatal visit.

The patient had a history of gestational diabetes in her previous pregnancy, further elevating her risk. Her obstetric history included delivering a baby with a birth weight exceeding 9 pounds. These symptoms, coupled with her medical history and previous gestational diabetes, indicated the need for an evaluation to assess the presence of gestational diabetes during her current pregnancy."
