  "Iritis_1": "Patient A, a 35-year-old female, presents with a three-week history of persistent discomfort in her right eye, rated at 4/10 on the pain scale. She reports increased sensitivity to light and a feeling of achiness in the affected eye. The patient has also noticed a gradual decrease in vision acuity in the same eye. On examination, the right eye exhibits marked redness. The development of symptoms in a single eye, along with the duration of more than three weeks and the presence of eye pain and vision problems, necessitates further evaluation to determine the underlying etiology.",
  "Iritis_2": "Patient B, a 40-year-old male, seeks medical attention for acute-onset eye redness and discomfort in both eyes. He describes the discomfort as a mild achiness (2/10 on the pain scale) and notes heightened sensitivity to light. The symptoms have been present for two days. Although the patient's vision is currently unaffected, he reports a history of recurrent eye redness and light sensitivity. The bilateral involvement and acute onset of symptoms indicate the need for a comprehensive diagnostic assessment to elucidate the underlying cause.",
  "Iritis_3": "Patient C, a 50-year-old male with no previous ocular history, reports a sudden onset of severe eye pain and redness in his left eye, which he rates at 8/10 in terms of intensity. He also experiences significant sensitivity to light. The pain has been relentless for the past 24 hours. Additionally, the patient has noticed decreased vision in the affected eye. The constellation of symptoms, including severe eye pain, pronounced redness, and decreased vision, strongly suggests a significant ocular pathology that requires urgent evaluation and management."
