  "Rheumatoid arthritis_2": "    A 45-year-old woman, with a family history of rheumatoid arthritis, presented with a three-month history of joint pain and swelling. She reported tenderness, warmth, and swelling in multiple joints, including the wrists, knuckles, and knees, with a morning stiffness lasting more than an hour. The joint symptoms have significantly affected her daily activities, and she described her pain as moderate to severe (6-8/10). Additionally, she has been experiencing fatigue, loss of appetite, and intermittent low-grade fevers. Given her family history and the observed symmetrical joint involvement, the diagnostic evaluation for rheumatoid arthritis is crucial in this case.",
  "Rheumatoid arthritis_4": "    A 60-year-old man, who has been a long-term smoker, presented with a complex set of symptoms, raising concerns for rheumatoid arthritis. He described a persistent joint stiffness, particularly in the mornings and after periods of inactivity, affecting his hands, elbows, and shoulders. The stiffness usually lasts for more than an hour and has a significant impact on his ability to perform manual tasks. He also reported a chronic feeling of fatigue and a noticeable loss of appetite. On examination, his joints exhibited mild swelling and warmth, and he had skin problems, including rheumatoid nodules. Given his age, smoking history, and the observed symptoms, a comprehensive diagnostic assessment for rheumatoid arthritis is warranted.",

She reported tender, swollen joints in her hands, feet, and knees, with a persistent morning joint stiffness lasting more than an hour. The pain in her joints was rated as moderate (5-7/10) and had been ongoing for the past six months.
