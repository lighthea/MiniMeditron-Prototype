  "Infectious complications associated with neuraxial techniques_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 45-year-old male patient, with a history of chronic back pain, presented with persistent fever (101\u00b0F) and a throbbing backache (pain level 7/10) following a recent lumbar epidural steroid injection for the management of his back pain. The fever has been ongoing for three days, accompanied by a severe headache. On examination, there is erythema and marked tenderness at the site of the epidural insertion. The patient's neurological function is intact. Given the known neuraxial intervention and the presence of fever, backache, erythema, and tenderness at the insertion site, there is a high index of suspicion for infectious complications associated with the neuraxial technique.",
  "Infectious complications associated with neuraxial techniques_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 55-year-old female patient, who underwent a spinal anesthesia for a gynecologic procedure, is now experiencing a complex set of symptoms. She has been running a low-grade fever (100.4\u00b0F) for the past five days, accompanied by a persistent backache (pain level 6/10) and a frontal headache. The patient reports erythema and tenderness at the site of the spinal anesthesia insertion. Furthermore, there is a subtle neurologic dysfunction, manifested as mild paraesthesia in her lower extremities. Review of her laboratory studies shows an elevated white blood cell count. The presence of fever, backache, headache, erythema, tenderness at the insertion site, and neurologic dysfunction, along with the laboratory findings, raises a strong concern for infectious complications associated with the prior neuraxial technique.",
  "Infectious complications associated with neuraxial techniques_3": "    Patient Description 3:\n    An 60-year-old male patient, with a history of recurrent bacteremia related to intravenous drug use, presented with a fever (102.2\u00b0F) and a worsening backache (pain level 8/10) following a recent spinal anesthesia for a hip arthroplasty. The fever has been escalating over the past three days, and the patient now also complains of a severe, diffuse headache. On examination, there is pronounced erythema and tenderness at the site of the spinal anesthesia insertion. Importantly, the patient exhibits neurologic dysfunction, characterized by motor weakness and sensory deficits in the lower extremities. Given the known history of bacteremia, along with the presence of fever, backache, headache, erythema, tenderness at the insertion site, and neurologic dysfunction, there is a high suspicion for infectious complications associated with the neuraxial technique, possibly exacerbated by the underlying bacteremia."
