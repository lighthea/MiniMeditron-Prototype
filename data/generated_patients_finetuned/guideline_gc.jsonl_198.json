  "PMRT for patients with T1-2 breast cancer with one to three positive axillary nodes_1": "\n    Patient A, a 48-year-old premenopausal woman with a documented medical history of T1 breast cancer, presented with concerning symptoms. She reported a lingering fear (LRF) of cancer recurrence, which has been significantly impacting her quality of life. Despite completing neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST) with a substantial response, she remains apprehensive about the possibility of disease recurrence. Given her age, limited life expectancy, and the presence of only a single positive axillary node, the patient's heightened anxiety regarding the recurrence of breast cancer is understandable. Her strong hormonal sensitivity and the low tumor grade further contribute to the complexity of her case. The recurrent fear is notably affecting her daily activities and mental well-being, warranting a comprehensive clinical assessment and appropriate intervention.",
  "PMRT for patients with T1-2 breast cancer with one to three positive axillary nodes_2": "    Patient B, a 55-year-old postmenopausal woman with a history of T2 breast cancer and one positive axillary node, presented with a recurrent fear (LRF) of cancer and a notable concern regarding breast cancer mortality. Despite completing treatment, she experiences persistent distress related to the possibility of disease recurrence and its potential impact on her life expectancy. This profound fear has led to increased anxiety and emotional burden, significantly affecting her overall well-being. Additionally, the patient's age, limited life expectancy, and the presence of coexisting conditions further exacerbate her apprehension. The recurrence-related distress and the fear of breast cancer mortality have become compelling clinical concerns, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation and the implementation of targeted interventions to address her emotional and psychological needs.",
  "PMRT for patients with T1-2 breast cancer with one to three positive axillary nodes_3": "    Patient C, a 42-year-old woman, was diagnosed with T1 breast cancer and a single positive axillary node. Following neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST), she completed her treatment and entered regular follow-up care. However, during her recent clinical visit, she expressed a recurring fear (LRF) of cancer, with an intense focus on the potential recurrence of her breast cancer. This persistent fear has been causing significant distress and has impacted her daily life, leading to heightened anxiety. The patient's strong hormonal sensitivity and the absence of lymphovascular invasion further contribute to the complexity of her case. Given her age and the presence of only one positive node, the recurrent fear of cancer recurrence has become a prominent clinical issue, requiring a comprehensive assessment and the implementation of targeted strategies to address her emotional well-being."
