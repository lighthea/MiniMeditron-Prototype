  "Heart failure_2": "Patient A, a 62-year-old male with a significant medical history of hypertension, presents with a constellation of concerning symptoms. He reports persistent dyspnea at rest and on exertion, which he describes as a 7/10 in severity, accompanied by a non-productive cough. Physical examination reveals pitting edema in both lower extremities. The patient's exercise tolerance has markedly decreased, and he experiences fatigue and malaise on a daily basis. These symptoms are indicative of reduced blood flow to body tissues, as well as oedema in the lungs, leading to breathlessness. Notably, the presence of swelling in the legs further supports our clinical suspicion. Given the contextual information of the patient's history of hypertension, the observed structural and functional abnormalities of the heart, and the constellation of symptoms, a comprehensive cardiac assessment is imperative to determine the underlying etiology.",
  "Heart failure_3": "Patient B, a 58-year-old female, presents with a complex array of symptoms that raise concerns regarding her cardiovascular health. She describes a persistent sensation of breathlessness, rated at 6/10 in severity, which is exacerbated by lying flat. The patient reports swelling and tightness in her legs, particularly towards the end of the day. Additionally, she has noticed a reduced ability to engage in routine physical activities, attributing it to a sensation of fatigue and general malaise. These symptoms collectively point towards reduced blood flow to body tissues, as well as oedema in the lungs, manifesting as breathlessness. The swelling of her legs further supports the clinical picture. Given these findings, along with the contextual information of the patient's symptoms, a comprehensive cardiac evaluation is warranted to elucidate the underlying pathology.",
  "Heart failure_4": "Patient C, a 65-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, seeks medical attention for a concerning set of symptoms. He complains of persistent dyspnea, which he rates at 5/10 in severity, and notes that it is often accompanied by cough, especially at night. The patient reports swelling and tightness in his lower extremities, which have been progressively worsening. He has also experienced a notable reduction in his exercise tolerance and frequently feels fatigued and unwell. These symptoms collectively point towards oedema in the lungs, reduced blood flow to body tissues, and the swelling of his legs. The contextual information of his coronary artery disease history further complicates the clinical picture. Given these findings, a comprehensive cardiac assessment is essential to determine the underlying etiology and optimize the management of his condition."
