  "In Vitro Fertilization_1": "  Case 1:\n  A 34-year-old female patient presented with a history of infertility for the past five years. She and her partner have been unable to conceive despite regular, unprotected intercourse. The patient has a regular menstrual cycle with a duration of 28-30 days. She has undergone multiple ovulation induction treatments without success. Additionally, she reports experiencing emotional distress and a high level of psychological burden due to her inability to conceive. Her pelvic examination and hormonal profile are within normal limits. The couple is keen on exploring assisted reproductive techniques, specifically in vitro fertilization (IVF).",
  "In Vitro Fertilization_2": "  Case 2:\n  A 38-year-old woman with a history of bilateral tubal occlusion due to previous pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) presented with secondary infertility. She has been attempting to conceive for three years without success. The patient reports occasional pelvic pain, which she describes as dull and intermittent, with a severity rating of 4/10. Her menstrual cycles are regular, and she has a normal hormonal profile. The pain is not consistently associated with her menstrual cycle. The patient and her partner are interested in pursuing fertility treatments, and given her tubal factor infertility, in vitro fertilization (IVF) has been recommended as a potential option.",
  "In Vitro Fertilization_3": "  Case 3:\n  A 29-year-old male patient with a history of non-obstructive azoospermia and low sperm count presented for fertility evaluation. He reports a lifestyle characterized by regular exercise, no history of sexually transmitted infections, and no exposure to gonadotoxins. The patient's semen analysis revealed persistent oligospermia, with a sperm count averaging 8 million/mL and reduced motility. He has been experiencing mild scrotal discomfort, rated at 3/10 in severity, which is not associated with trauma or infections. The patient is interested in exploring options for assisted reproduction, and in vitro fertilization (IVF) has been suggested as a potential approach to achieve pregnancy."
