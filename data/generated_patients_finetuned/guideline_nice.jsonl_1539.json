  "Long-gap oesophageal atresia_3": "A 3-week-old male infant, born at full term with no notable prenatal or birth complications, is presenting with concerning symptoms. The parents have observed frequent episodes of coughing and choking during feeding, often accompanied by cyanosis. The infant is unable to feed adequately and exhibits signs of malnutrition, despite increased feeding frequency. Additionally, there is a persistent issue of saliva and milk pooling in the upper oesophagus, leading to recurrent aspiration pneumonia. Although gastro-oesophageal reflux is evident, it is not responsive to standard treatment. Given the congenital nature of the condition and the presence of blind pouches at the ends of the oesophagus, a thorough diagnostic evaluation is imperative.",
  "Long-gap oesophageal atresia_5": "A 5-month-old female infant, with a history of prematurity and low birth weight, is being evaluated for a complex set of symptoms. The infant has been experiencing recurrent episodes of coughing and cyanosis, especially during feeding, suggesting the presence of a tracheo-oesophageal fistula. Furthermore, there is a notable challenge with feeding, as evidenced by choking episodes and persistent pooling of saliva and milk in the upper oesophagus. These difficulties have led to malnutrition, despite aggressive feeding efforts. The infant's medical history is also remarkable for multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia. The diagnostic process is complicated by the prematurity and associated comorbidities, necessitating a comprehensive assessment to guide an appropriate treatment plan.",
  "Long-gap oesophageal atresia_7": "A 2-week-old male infant, delivered at full term without complications, is presenting with a challenging medical profile. The parents have observed frequent episodes of coughing, cyanosis, and choking during feeding, indicating a potential tracheo-oesophageal fistula. In addition, there is pooling of saliva and milk in the upper oesophagus, further complicating the feeding process. Despite intervention, the infant continues to experience gastro-oesophageal reflux, contributing to the overall clinical picture. The presence of these symptoms is concerning, given the possibility of long-gap oesophageal atresia. A prompt and comprehensive diagnostic assessment is essential to guide the management of this congenital condition."
