  "Frostbite_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 35-year-old male patient, with a history of alcohol use, presented with concerning symptoms following a recent outdoor camping trip in sub-zero temperatures. The patient reported persistent cold skin and a prickling sensation in his hands and feet. He described numbness in these areas and noted that his skin appeared red and waxy. Additionally, he experienced clumsiness and stiffness in his joints, which he attributed to the recent cold exposure. On examination, we observed bluish discoloration in the affected areas. The patient's alcohol use and the outdoor excursion in severe cold are important contextual factors to consider in the diagnostic evaluation.",
  "Frostbite_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 50-year-old female patient, who resides in a high-altitude region, presented with a concerning medical issue. She reported a prolonged exposure to cold temperatures due to her occupation as a mountain guide. The patient described a persistent numbness and cold sensation in her hands and feet, accompanied by skin discoloration that alternated between white, bluish-white, and grayish-yellow. She also exhibited hard, waxy-looking skin in the affected areas. Given her occupation and the high-altitude environment, diagnostic considerations should encompass her occupational cold exposure and the influence of high altitude on the presentation of symptoms.",
  "Frostbite_3": "    Patient Description 3:\n    An 19-year-old male patient, without any significant medical history, sought medical attention for an unusual condition. He reported a recent episode of camping in cold, snowy weather, during which he developed cold skin, numbness, and a prickling sensation in his hands and feet. The patient's skin in these areas displayed a red, ashen appearance, accompanied by joint and muscle stiffness, leading to clumsiness. The presence of these symptoms following cold exposure during the camping trip is a vital contextual factor to consider in the diagnostic assessment."
