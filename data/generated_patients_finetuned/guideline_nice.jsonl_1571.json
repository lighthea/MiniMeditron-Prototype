  "End-stage osteoarthritis_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 68-year-old male patient, with a history of manual labor in the construction industry, presented with debilitating symptoms in his hand joints. The pain, which he described as 9/10 on the visual analog scale, has progressed over the last five years, severely impacting his ability to grasp, hold, and manipulate objects.

  "End-stage osteoarthritis_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 62-year-old female patient, with a sedentary lifestyle, reported excruciating pain in her hand joints, which she rated as 8/10 in intensity. The severity of her symptoms has led to a notable decline in her manual dexterity and grip strength over the past three years. Despite attempting non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and splinting as conservative measures, the rate of deterioration in her hand function has raised diagnostic concerns. The impact of the symptoms on her daily activities, coupled with the progressive nature of the condition, necessitates a thorough assessment to determine an appropriate course of action.",
  "End-stage osteoarthritis_3": "    Patient Description 3:\n    A 70-year-old male patient, with a history of hand-intensive hobbies such as woodworking, presented with severe and unrelenting pain (rated 9/10) in his hand joints.
