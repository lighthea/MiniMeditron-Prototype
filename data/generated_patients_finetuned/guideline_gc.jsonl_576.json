  "Prostate Cancer_2": "    A 62-year-old male patient, with a history of hypertension, presented with urinary symptoms. He reported a gradual onset of weak urine stream and increased frequency of urination, especially at night. The patient described his pain level as 2/10, primarily due to the discomfort of frequent urination disrupting his sleep. Digital rectal examination revealed a palpable nodule on the prostate gland. Given the patient's age and the observed urinary symptoms, further diagnostic evaluation is imperative to determine the extent and risk stratification of the prostate condition.",
  "Prostate Cancer_4": "    A 72-year-old male patient, with a history of diabetes and coronary artery disease, reported lower urinary tract symptoms. He described his pain level as 4/10, characterized by a persistent dull ache in the lower abdomen. The patient has been experiencing intermittently obstructed urine flow and recurrent urinary tract infections. Digital rectal examination showed asymmetry and firmness in the prostate gland. Given the patient's age and comorbidities, as well as the nature of his urinary symptoms, a comprehensive diagnostic assessment is essential to stratify the risk and determine the most appropriate management approach.",
  "Prostate Cancer_6": "    A 58-year-old male patient, with no significant medical history, presented with urinary complaints. He reported a pain level of 6/10, describing a sharp, intermittent pain in the perineal area. The patient's urination pattern had changed, with increased hesitancy and the sensation of incomplete bladder emptying. Digital rectal examination revealed an irregular and hardened area in the prostate gland. Given the patient's age and the presence of significant urinary symptoms, along with the elevated pain level, an urgent comprehensive diagnostic workup is necessary to assess the extent and risk stratification of the prostate condition."
