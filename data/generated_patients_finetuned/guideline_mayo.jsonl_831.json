  "Prolactinoma_1": "   Patient A, a 35-year-old female, presents with a complex array of symptoms. She reports irregular menstrual periods, milky discharge from her breasts, painful intercourse due to vaginal dryness, and persistent acne accompanied by excessive body and facial hair growth. These symptoms have substantially impacted her quality of life and contributed to a loss of interest in sexual activity. Remarkably, Patient A has a history of weak and brittle bones, with recurrent fractures suggestive of osteoporosis. Additionally, she has been experiencing vision problems and recurrent headaches. The diagnostic process is further complicated by the premenopausal status of the patient, necessitating careful consideration of hormonal fluctuations. Given the constellation of symptoms and the contextual factors, a comprehensive evaluation is imperative to elucidate the underlying pathology and guide appropriate management.",
  "Prolactinoma_2": "   Patient B, a 28-year-old male, seeks medical evaluation for a concerning set of symptoms. He describes a persistent issue with erectile dysfunction, decreased body and facial hair, as well as a noticeable reduction in muscle mass. Notably, he has also observed the enlargement of his breast tissue. These manifestations have led to a sense of distress and prompted his decision to seek medical attention. Given the unique hormonal dynamics in males and the size of the underlying tumor, the diagnostic process for Patient B necessitates a gender-specific approach. A comprehensive assessment is crucial to establish a precise diagnosis and formulate an effective treatment plan tailored to his needs.",
  "Prolactinoma_3": "   Patient C, a 45-year-old individual, reports a range of troubling symptoms, including decreased libido, vision problems, and recurrent headaches. Notably, Patient C has experienced a reduction in other hormones produced by the pituitary gland, adding complexity to the clinical presentation. The interplay of these symptoms, along with the patient's medical history, warrants a thorough evaluation to determine the underlying cause. The diagnostic process is further influenced by the postmenopausal status of the patient, necessitating a comprehensive assessment of tumor size and its impact. A holistic approach is essential to unravel the complexity of Patient C's condition and guide appropriate management."
