  "Acute Dizziness and Vertigo_1": "Description 1:\nA 55-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presented with a sudden onset of severe dizziness and vertigo, which he described as an 8/10 in terms of intensity, associated with nystagmus. His symptoms were accompanied by gait unsteadiness and limb coordination abnormalities, leading to a significant impact on his daily activities. The patient denied any hearing loss but reported cranial nerve abnormalities, including visual field abnormalities. Notably, he expressed a preference for short-term steroid treatment. The presence of these symptoms, along with the patient's medical history, underscores the need for a comprehensive assessment to determine the underlying etiology and guide an appropriate treatment plan.",
  "Acute Dizziness and Vertigo_2": "Description 2:\nA 45-year-old female patient, with no significant medical history, presented to the clinic with acute-onset dizziness and vertigo. She reported a constant feeling of unsteadiness in her gait, which she rated as 7/10 in terms of severity, along with nystagmus. The patient also experienced gait abnormalities and visual field abnormalities. She denied any hearing loss but exhibited limb coordination abnormalities. Given the absence of relevant medical history and the presence of these symptoms, a thorough diagnostic evaluation is imperative to elucidate the underlying cause of her condition and determine the most suitable management approach.",
  "Acute Dizziness and Vertigo_3": "Description 3:\nA 65-year-old male patient, known for a history of recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), presented to the emergency department with acute dizziness and vertigo. He reported a 6/10 intensity of dizziness, accompanied by nystagmus and cranial nerve abnormalities. The patient exhibited gait unsteadiness and visual field abnormalities. His medical history raised concerns regarding the potential impact of TIA on his current symptoms. Therefore, an urgent and comprehensive diagnostic assessment is crucial to differentiate the etiology of his condition, taking into account the presence of posterior canal BPPV and the history of TIAs, and to implement an appropriate management strategy."
