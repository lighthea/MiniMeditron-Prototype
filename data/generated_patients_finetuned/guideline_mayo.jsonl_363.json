  "Epidermoid cysts_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 32-year-old female patient presented with a persistent, small, round bump on her neck, which she described as mildly tender (pain level 2/10). The lesion has been gradually increasing in size over the past six months, and the patient expressed cosmetic concerns. Physical examination revealed a tiny blackhead plugging the central opening of the cyst, along with redness and swelling in the surrounding area. There was no evidence of infection at this stage. Given the lesion's growth rate, the presence of a blackhead, and the patient's cosmetic concerns, further evaluation is warranted to confirm the diagnosis and discuss treatment options.",
  "Epidermoid cysts_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 45-year-old male patient sought medical attention for a recurrent issue characterized by a small, round bump on his face, specifically on the left cheek. The patient reported intermittent episodes of discomfort and tenderness around the bump, with varying pain levels (ranging from 3 to 5/10). He noted a history of occasional drainage of thick, yellow, and malodorous material from the lesion. Physical examination revealed redness, tenderness, and a persistent blackhead in the central opening of the cyst. The recurrent nature of symptoms, along with the presence of drainage and fluctuating pain levels, indicates the need for further assessment to address potential infection and explore appropriate management strategies.",
  "Epidermoid cysts_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 50-year-old female patient presented with a chronic issue involving a small, round bump on her upper back. The patient described constant irritation (pain level 4/10) in the affected area, which had been ongoing for over a year. She noted occasional drainage of thick, yellow material from the lesion. On examination, the cyst showed signs of inflammation, including redness, swelling, and tenderness. The patient's history of constant irritation, along with the inflamed and infected nature of the cyst, underscores the need for a comprehensive evaluation to determine an optimal treatment approach and address the patient's symptoms and discomfort."
