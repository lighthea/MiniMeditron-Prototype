  "Metastatic or Advanced Solid Tumors_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 58-year-old male, with a significant history of smoking (30 pack-years), presented with a persistent dry cough, shortness of breath (Grade 2, exacerbated on exertion), and recurrent episodes of hemoptysis. He has previously undergone standard chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer. Despite initial response, the symptoms have gradually worsened. The diagnostic workup should consider the prevalence of NTRK fusions in NSCLC and the potential for fusion-targeted therapies, given the patient's history of treatment resistance.",
  "Metastatic or Advanced Solid Tumors_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 45-year-old female patient, never-smoker, with a history of non-small cell lung cancer, presented with worsening chest pain (Grade 3) that is not adequately controlled with over-the-counter analgesics. She also reported unintentional weight loss, night sweats, and a persistent cough. The diagnostic evaluation should carefully assess the presence of NTRK fusions in her tumor, considering the potential for fusion-targeted therapies and the context of her advanced disease.",
  "Metastatic or Advanced Solid Tumors_3": "    Patient Description 3:\n    A 62-year-old male patient, former smoker (20 pack-years), was previously diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer and underwent surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. He is now experiencing progressive fatigue, dyspnea (Grade 1), and recurrent chest infections. The diagnostic workup needs to consider the prevalence of NTRK fusions in NSCLC, especially in the context of the patient's disease recurrence, to explore the potential benefits of fusion-targeted therapies."
