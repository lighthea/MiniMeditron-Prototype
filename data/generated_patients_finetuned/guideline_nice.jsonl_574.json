  "Parastomal hernia_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 65-year-old female patient, with a history of multiple abdominal surgeries, presented with a parastomal hernia. She described the appearance of her stoma as \"unacceptable,\" and despite multiple adjustments, she continues to experience a poorly fitting stoma device, which has led to significant discomfort and a persistent sensation of dragging around the stoma site. The patient reported intermittent episodes of abdominal pain (4/10 in intensity) and bloating. Notably, she has noticed a gradual increase in the size of the bulge around her stoma, which is more pronounced during episodes of straining or lifting. Physical examination revealed a palpable mass adjacent to the stoma, and imaging studies confirmed the presence of a parastomal hernia. Given the chronic nature of her symptoms and the gradual development of the hernia, diagnostic and treatment strategies must take into account her prior abdominal surgeries and the potential for bowel obstruction, ischaemia, or strangulation.",
  "Parastomal hernia_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 55-year-old male patient, who underwent a colostomy procedure following extensive pelvic surgery for rectal cancer two years ago, presented with concerning symptoms related to a parastomal hernia. He reported a persistent feeling of dissatisfaction with the physical appearance of his stoma, often describing it as \"unsightly\" and \"bulging.\" Despite using various stoma devices, he continues to struggle with a poorly fitting appliance, leading to leakage and skin irritation. The patient experienced recurrent episodes of abdominal pain (6/10 in intensity), associated with bloating and a sense of fullness. These symptoms have been gradually worsening over the past few months. Upon examination, a visible and palpable bulge was noted around the stoma, which increased in size when the patient strained. Given the context of his extensive pelvic surgery and the gradual progression of symptoms, a parastomal hernia is highly suspected, and diagnostic evaluation is crucial to assess the extent of bowel involvement and the risk of obstruction or strangulation.",
  "Parastomal hernia_3": "    Patient Description 3:\n    A 70-year-old male patient, with a history of diverticular disease and a sigmoid colostomy performed five years ago, presented with symptoms suggestive of a parastomal hernia. He expressed deep concerns about the appearance of his stoma, often feeling that it is \"unsightly\" and protruding more than usual. Despite multiple stoma appliance adjustments, he reported ongoing issues with a poorly fitting device, causing frequent leaks and peristomal skin irritation. The patient described intermittent, crampy abdominal pain (5/10 in intensity) and recurrent episodes of bowel bloating. These symptoms have gradually worsened over the past year. Physical examination revealed a noticeable bulge adjacent to the stoma, which became more prominent during straining. Given his history of diverticular disease and the gradual development of symptoms, the presence of a parastomal hernia is highly suspected. Diagnostic assessment is imperative to determine the extent of the hernia and its potential impact on bowel function, as well as to address the risk of bowel obstruction or ischaemia."
