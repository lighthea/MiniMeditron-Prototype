  "Popliteal artery aneurysms_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 62-year-old male, with a history of smoking and hypertension, presented with a concerning pattern of symptoms. He reported recurrent episodes of acute, severe pain in his left lower leg, which he described as a throbbing sensation accompanied by a feeling of coldness. The pain episodes have been increasing in frequency over the past two months and are often triggered by minimal physical activity. Additionally, the patient noted occasional episodes of numbness and tingling in the affected leg. Physical examination revealed a diminished pedal pulse and coolness of the left foot. Notably, the patient has not undergone any previous vascular interventions. Given the constellation of symptoms and the patient's history, a comprehensive evaluation is warranted to elucidate the underlying vascular pathology.",
  "Popliteal artery aneurysms_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 74-year-old female, with a long-standing history of peripheral arterial disease and a prior femoral artery bypass surgery, presented with a sudden onset of severe right lower leg pain. The pain, which she rated as 8/10 in intensity, was constant and localized to the calf region. The affected leg appeared dusky, and the patient reported episodes of intermittent claudication that had worsened in the past week. Despite her prescribed antiplatelet medication, the symptoms persisted. Physical examination revealed a palpable, pulsatile mass behind the right knee. Given the acute nature of the presentation, coupled with the patient's medical history, urgent assessment and intervention are imperative to address the underlying etiology and prevent potential complications.",
  "Popliteal artery aneurysms_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 55-year-old male, a nonsmoker with no significant medical history, presented with a history of recurrent, crampy pain in his right lower leg. He described the pain as intermittent, with an intensity of 6/10, often precipitated by walking moderate distances. The discomfort typically subsided with rest. Over the past month, the patient also noticed discoloration and coolness of his right foot during these episodes. Physical examination revealed a palpable mass behind the right knee, and the absence of distal pulses in the affected leg. Doppler ultrasound showed evidence of thrombosis in the popliteal artery. Given the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings, further evaluation is essential to determine the optimal management strategy for the patient's condition."
