  "Breast Masses, Breast Complaints, and Diagnostic Breast Imaging in the Lactating Woman_1": "  Patient Description 1:\nA 30-year-old woman, G2P2, with a history of smoking, presented with a non-cyclical, persistent breast pain rated at 6/10 in intensity, localized to the left breast's upper outer quadrant. She also reported a nipple discharge, described as serous with a yellowish tinge. The pain has been ongoing for three weeks and is not alleviated by over-the-counter analgesics. Physical examination revealed erythema and a palpable, tender mass in the same region. Given her history of smoking, these symptoms warrant a comprehensive evaluation, considering the possibility of non-lactation-specific masses and the influence of smoking on breast health.",
  "Breast Masses, Breast Complaints, and Diagnostic Breast Imaging in the Lactating Woman_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 28-year-old primigravida woman in her third trimester of pregnancy presented with a lactation-specific breast concern. She reported a persistent plugged duct in the lower quadrant of her right breast, accompanied by recurrent irritation while wearing a bra and a sensation of fullness. The patient noted that the plugged duct had not resolved despite attempts of massage and warm compresses. On examination, a palpable, tender mass was identified in the ductal distribution, consistent with her reported symptoms. Given the physiological changes during pregnancy and the persistent nature of the plugged duct, further diagnostic breast imaging is recommended to guide appropriate management.",
  "Breast Masses, Breast Complaints, and Diagnostic Breast Imaging in the Lactating Woman_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 35-year-old lactating woman, G1P1, with a history of atopy and allergies, presented with a non-mass breast complaint. She described a persistent itching and oozing lesion on her left nipple and areola, associated with eczematous changes. The pruritus was rated at 7/10 in intensity and had been present for four weeks. She also reported a yellowish-green nipple discharge. Physical examination revealed the described lesion, along with erythema and dermatitis. Given the patient's history of atopy and the atypical nipple changes, a comprehensive diagnostic assessment is essential to address her non-mass breast complaints and ensure appropriate management in the context of her allergic tendencies."
