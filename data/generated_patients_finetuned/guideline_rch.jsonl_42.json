  "Drug Allergy_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 33-year-old female patient, with a history of atopic disease, presented with a constellation of symptoms following the ingestion of a newly prescribed antibiotic (amoxicillin) for a respiratory tract infection. The immediate reaction (<1 hour after ingestion) was marked by the development of a non-specific, maculopapular rash on her trunk and extremities, accompanied by urticarial lesions. The patient also reported respiratory symptoms, including mild wheezing and increased work of breathing. She described a sensation of dizziness but did not experience collapse. Additionally, she complained of joint and muscle pain, further raising suspicion of a drug allergy. No concurrent illness or use of other medications was reported. Notably, there was a previous history of tolerating different antibiotics. The timing of the reaction, type of symptoms, and the patient's atopic disease background are significant factors affecting the diagnostic process.",
  "Drug Allergy_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 45-year-old male patient, with no history of atopic disease, presented with an alarming drug reaction. Within minutes of ingesting a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for a musculoskeletal injury, the patient experienced a sudden onset of airway angioedema, involving his lips and tongue, leading to significant respiratory distress. He also exhibited mucous membrane involvement, with swelling around the eyes and mouth. The patient's condition required immediate treatment, including the use of an adrenaline auto-injector and a bronchodilator to alleviate the airway constriction. There were no concurrently administered drugs or concurrent illnesses. The rapid onset and severe nature of the patient's symptoms, coupled with the absence of a previous history of drug allergies, underscore the critical importance of timely diagnostic assessment and intervention.",
  "Drug Allergy_3": "    Patient Description 3:\n    A 28-year-old male patient, with a past history of non-drug allergies, presented with delayed reaction symptoms (>1 hour after ingestion) following the consumption of a new medication for gastric acid reflux. The patient developed a rash, characterized by maculopapular lesions, several hours after taking the medication. He also reported gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain and nausea. The absence of respiratory manifestations distinguished this reaction from an immediate hypersensitivity response. Notably, the patient had experienced similar skin reactions to non-drug allergens in the past. The duration of symptoms and the time to recovery, along with the patient's history of non-drug allergies, are crucial factors influencing the diagnostic evaluation of this drug allergy."
