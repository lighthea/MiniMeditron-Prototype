  "Hip Osteoarthritis_1": "    Case 1:\n    A 58-year-old male patient presented with a persistent complaint of moderate anterior hip pain (rated 5/10) during weight-bearing activities, such as walking and climbing stairs. He reports experiencing morning stiffness in the hip joint, which lasts for approximately 30 minutes after wakening. Physical examination revealed a reduced internal rotation range of motion in the hip, measuring less than 24\u00b0 compared to the nonpainful side. Additionally, passive hip internal rotation maneuver elicited an increase in the patient's hip pain. The combination of the patient's age and the characteristic hip pain pattern raises concerns for a specific musculoskeletal condition, warranting further diagnostic assessment.",
  "Hip Osteoarthritis_2": "    Case 2:\n    A 62-year-old female patient with a history of hip discomfort visited our clinic. She described a persistent, moderate lateral hip pain (rated 6/10) that is exacerbated during weight-bearing activities, such as walking and standing. The patient reported morning stiffness in the hip joint, lasting less than an hour after waking. Physical examination revealed a reduction in both hip internal rotation range of motion and hip flexion, with measurements approximately 15\u00b0 less than the nonpainful side. Passive hip internal rotation further exacerbated the patient's hip pain. Given the patient's age and the constellation of symptoms, a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is crucial to determine the underlying etiology of her hip condition.",
  "Hip Osteoarthritis_3": "    Case 3:\n    A 55-year-old patient, who leads an active lifestyle, presented with moderate anterior hip pain (rated 4/10) that is consistently experienced during weight-bearing activities, especially when engaging in exercise and prolonged standing. The patient reported morning stiffness in the hip joint, which typically resolves within 40 minutes after waking. Physical examination revealed a notable reduction in hip internal rotation range of motion, as well as decreased hip flexion, with measurements 15\u00b0 lower than the nonpainful side. Passive hip internal rotation maneuvers exacerbated the patient's hip pain. Given the patient's age, lifestyle, and the characteristic hip pain pattern, a comprehensive diagnostic assessment is necessary to elucidate the nature of the hip joint pathology."
