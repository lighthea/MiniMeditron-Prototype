  "Ventricular septal defect_1": "1. Ms. A, a 28-year-old female with a history of a small asymptomatic ventricular septal defect (VSD) diagnosed in childhood, presented with gradually increasing shortness of breath (NYHA class II) during physical activities. She reported occasional palpitations and easy fatigue, which have notably affected her active lifestyle as a fitness enthusiast. Despite her persistent symptoms, she has not received any prior cardiac interventions. Physical examination revealed a harsh holosystolic murmur along the left sternal border. Echocardiography is warranted to assess the current size of the VSD and its hemodynamic impact, given the onset of congestive heart failure symptoms and the patient's desire for a definitive management plan.",
  "Ventricular septal defect_2": "2. Mr. B, a 42-year-old male, was referred to our cardiology clinic due to a long-standing history of pulmonary vascular disease of unknown etiology. He reported exertional dyspnea, which has progressively worsened over the past two years and is now present even at rest (NYHA class III). Notably, he experienced recurrent respiratory infections and had an episode of infective endocarditis five years ago, necessitating antimicrobial therapy. Physical examination revealed wide fixed splitting of the second heart sound and prominent jugular venous pulsations. Given the persistent pulmonary vascular disease, increased risk of infective endocarditis, and the history of previous cardiac infection, an echocardiogram is crucial to assess for the presence and hemodynamic significance of a ventricular septal defect (VSD).",
  "Ventricular septal defect_3": "3. Baby C, a 6-month-old infant, was brought to the pediatric cardiology clinic due to poor weight gain, diaphoresis during feeding, and a harsh systolic murmur on cardiac auscultation. The infant has a known large ventricular septal defect (VSD) since birth, which was initially asymptomatic. However, the recent onset of congestive heart failure symptoms, as evidenced by diaphoresis and inadequate weight gain, is concerning. The parents reported a history of viral illness in the child two weeks prior. Given the age of the patient, the presence of symptoms, and the increased risk of infective endocarditis following the recent viral illness, an echocardiogram is urgently needed to evaluate the VSD's current size, its hemodynamic effects, and potential sequelae such as infective endocarditis."
