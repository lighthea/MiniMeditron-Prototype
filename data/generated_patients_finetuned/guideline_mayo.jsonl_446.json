Physical examination revealed warmth and swelling near the wrist joint. The injury occurred during a fall while playing. Given the age of the child and the observed symptoms, a growth plate fracture in the right forearm is highly suspected.",
  "Growth plate fracture_3": "Patient Description 2:\nA 14-year-old female patient, who is actively involved in gymnastics, reported to the clinic with a chief complaint of persistent pain in her left knee, which she described as 6/10 in severity. The pain is specifically localized to the knee joint and is more pronounced when pressure is applied to the area, eliciting tenderness. The patient experiences difficulty in bearing weight on her left leg and has noticed swelling and warmth around the affected knee. These symptoms have been ongoing for two weeks and have not improved with rest. The age of the adolescent, coupled with the nature of her physical activities, raises concerns about a growth plate fracture in the left knee.",
  "Growth plate fracture_4": "Patient Description 3:\nA 12-year-old male patient, who is actively involved in organized sports, presented with acute, localized pain in his right ankle, which he rated as 8/10 in intensity. The pain is exacerbated by pressure on the ankle and is associated with marked tenderness at the site. The patient is unable to bear weight on his right leg and has difficulty moving the affected ankle joint. Physical examination revealed significant warmth and swelling near the end of the tibia. The injury occurred during a soccer game. Given the severity of the symptoms, along with the patient's age and the nature of his physical activities, a growth plate fracture in the right ankle is a strong consideration."
