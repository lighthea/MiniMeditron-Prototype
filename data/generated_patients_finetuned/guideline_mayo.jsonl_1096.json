  "Wrist pain_1": "  Description 1:\n  A 40-year-old right-handed male patient, who works as a carpenter, presented with a chief complaint of persistent, localized wrist pain. The pain, rated 6/10 in severity, has been ongoing for the past 6 weeks and is accompanied by tenderness and swelling over the dorsal aspect of the right wrist. The patient reported a noticeable decrease in his range of motion and grip strength in the affected wrist, which has started to impede his occupational tasks. There is also a history of recent minor trauma from a fall at the worksite. No deformity is evident on initial examination. These symptoms, along with the occupational context and the duration, location, and severity of the pain, warrant a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to determine the underlying etiology.",
  "Wrist pain_2": "  Description 2:\n  A 30-year-old, left-handed female patient, who is an avid tennis player, presented with a complex wrist condition. She described a sharp, intermittent pain in her dominant hand, with a severity rating of 7/10, which worsens during backhand strokes. The pain has been present for two months and is associated with both tenderness and swelling on the ulnar side of her left wrist. The decreased grip strength and forearm strength in her dominant hand are notably affecting her athletic performance. The patient denied any history of trauma but reported a sensation of numbness and tingling in her hand, particularly during activities. These symptoms, in the context of her handedness, sporting activities, and the presence of numbness, necessitate a thorough diagnostic assessment to pinpoint the underlying pathology.",
  "Wrist pain_3": "  Description 3:\n  A 55-year-old, right-handed male patient, employed as a computer programmer, came in with chronic wrist pain. He reported a persistent, dull ache in his right wrist, with a pain score of 5/10, which has been ongoing for the past three months. The pain is associated with noticeable swelling and tenderness around the radial aspect of his wrist. The patient has experienced a decrease in his range of motion and grip strength, which is interfering with his typing and mouse usage at work. There is no history of recent injury. However, his occupation involves prolonged use of computer peripherals. The duration, location, occupational context, and the associated decrease in wrist function indicate the need for a comprehensive diagnostic workup to identify the root cause of his wrist pain."
