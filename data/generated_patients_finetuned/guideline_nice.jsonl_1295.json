  "Coronary artery disease (CAD)_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 58-year-old male patient, with a notable medical history of long-term smoking and a family history of cardiovascular disease, presented with recurrent episodes of angina. The chest pain, described as a pressing sensation, often occurs during physical exertion and subsides with rest. The patient's angina episodes have increased in frequency over the past month, with several instances occurring at rest. Despite being on prescribed nitroglycerin, the frequency and intensity of his angina have become concerning. Given the patient's lifestyle risk factors and the progressive nature of his symptoms, a comprehensive evaluation is warranted to assess the severity of coronary artery disease and determine the most appropriate management strategy.",
  "Coronary artery disease (CAD)_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 62-year-old female patient, without significant prior cardiovascular history, presented to the emergency department with a sudden-onset, severe retrosternal chest pain. The pain, which she described as crushing and radiating to her left arm, was associated with diaphoresis and shortness of breath. The patient's pain level was self-rated at 9/10 in intensity. Upon arrival, an electrocardiogram revealed ST-segment elevation, indicative of an acute myocardial infarction. The prompt initiation of reperfusion therapy resulted in the resolution of her myocardial infarction symptoms. However, the patient's case underscores the acute and life-threatening nature of coronary artery disease, emphasizing the critical need for appropriate interventions and post-incident management.",
  "Coronary artery disease (CAD)_3": "    Patient Description 3:\n    A 70-year-old male patient, known for a history of hypertension and diabetes, presented with progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and lower-extremity edema. His symptoms have been escalating over the past six months, and he now reports frequent nighttime awakenings due to shortness of breath. The patient's exercise tolerance has markedly decreased, and he experiences paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, which is alleviated by sitting upright. Physical examination revealed bilateral basal crackles and elevated jugular venous pressure. These clinical findings, in conjunction with the patient's cardiac risk factors, raise concerns about underlying heart failure secondary to coronary artery disease. A comprehensive diagnostic assessment is essential to determine the extent of the cardiac impairment and guide the initiation of appropriate treatment modalities."
