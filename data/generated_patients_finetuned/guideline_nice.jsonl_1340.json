  "Shoulder joint disease_1": "  Patient A, a 45-year-old avid tennis player, presents with a persistent and dull ache in the right shoulder, which he rates at 4/10 on the pain scale. The pain has been gradually worsening over the past six months and is particularly exacerbated during serving and overhead shots on the tennis court, leading to functional limitations in his game. Despite prior conservative management with rest and physical therapy, the reduced quality of life associated with this shoulder discomfort has prompted his visit. The diagnostic process is further challenged by the underlying condition of repetitive high-intensity shoulder movements in the context of his athletic lifestyle.",
  "Shoulder joint disease_2": "  Patient B, a 60-year-old individual with a history of manual labor, reports aching and throbbing pain in the left shoulder, consistently rated at 6/10 in intensity. This discomfort has been troubling him for over a year and is notably aggravated when performing overhead tasks or lifting heavy objects, leading to a significant functional limitation in his occupation as a construction worker. The reduced quality of life has prompted him to seek medical attention after attempting various over-the-counter pain relievers with minimal relief. The underlying occupational history adds complexity to the diagnostic evaluation.",
  "Shoulder joint disease_3": "  Patient C, a 55-year-old office worker, describes a persistent, deep-seated ache in her right shoulder, which she rates at 5/10 in severity. The pain has been present for eight months and is notably exacerbated during prolonged periods of computer work and when reaching overhead. These symptoms have led to functional limitations in her daily tasks and recreational activities. Despite modifying her workspace ergonomics and engaging in shoulder-strengthening exercises, the reduced quality of life associated with the ongoing shoulder discomfort has prompted her to seek further medical assessment. The diagnostic process is complicated by the absence of a specific traumatic event or occupational risk factors."
