  "Idiopathic scoliosis_1": "**Patient Description 1**\nA 14-year-old female patient, otherwise healthy, presented with a noticeable asymmetry in her back, as reported by her parents. The patient has been complaining of intermittent, mild to moderate back pain, which is exacerbated by prolonged sitting and physical activities such as sports. On physical examination, we observed twisted or rotated bones of the spine, a significant sideways curvature, and a visible spinal deformity. Notably, the severity and location of the spinal curve, as well as the pattern and progression of the curve, will be crucial in our diagnostic assessment.",
  "Idiopathic scoliosis_2": "**Patient Description 2**\nA 20-year-old male patient, with no significant past medical history, presented with a concerning spinal issue. The patient reported persistent, dull back pain, with pain levels ranging from moderate to severe, especially after long hours of standing or strenuous activity. Physical examination revealed evident twisted or rotated bones of the spine, along with a pronounced sideways curvature and spinal deformity. The diagnostic process will need to consider the patient's age, the severity and location of the spinal curve, as well as the pattern and progression of the observed spinal deformity.",
  "Idiopathic scoliosis_3": "**Patient Description 3**\nA 12-year-old male patient, who is actively involved in various sports activities, visited our clinic with complaints of recurrent back pain. The pain, described as mild to moderate, is often triggered during athletic involvement and has persisted for several months. Upon examination, we noted twisted or rotated bones of the spine, a notable sideways curvature, and a visible spinal deformity. The patient's age, lifestyle, and the specific characteristics of the spinal curve, including its severity, location, pattern, and progression, will be essential factors in the diagnostic evaluation."
