  "Precocious puberty_1": "     Patient Description 1:\nA 7-year-old female patient was brought in by her parents, who have noticed the development of breast tissue over the past few months. The girl has also experienced her first menstrual period, which is highly unusual for her age. She has been exhibiting signs of rapid growth and is now significantly taller than her peers. Additionally, the patient has been struggling with acne and adult body odor. There are no known genetic or familial factors that could account for these symptoms. The presence of both breast development and early menstruation at such a young age raises concerns, prompting a thorough diagnostic evaluation to determine the underlying cause.",
  "Precocious puberty_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 9-year-old male patient has been referred for evaluation of precocious puberty. The boy's parents have observed pronounced growth in his testicles and penis, along with the development of facial hair and a deeper voice. He has also begun to grow pubic and underarm hair. The patient's rapid physical growth is evident, and he has been experiencing emotional and behavioral changes that are atypical for his age. There is no family history of early puberty. Given the presence of multiple advanced sexual characteristics in a prepubertal child, further assessment is warranted to identify the underlying etiology.",
  "Precocious puberty_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 6-year-old female patient has presented with early signs of puberty, including the growth of breast tissue and the appearance of pubic and underarm hair. Her parents have also noticed a rapid growth spurt in their child. The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, which is being managed with levothyroxine. Despite adequate thyroid hormone replacement, her symptoms of precocious puberty have persisted. The combination of early breast development, pubic hair, and rapid growth in the context of treated hypothyroidism necessitates a comprehensive diagnostic workup to elucidate the contributing factors and determine an appropriate course of action."
