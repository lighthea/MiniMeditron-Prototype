  "Flail chest_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 58-year-old male, non-smoker, with a history of a recent motor vehicle accident, presented with severe chest pain (rated 8/10) that is exacerbated by deep inspiration and coughing. Physical examination revealed paradoxical movement of the chest wall, with visible in-drawing during inspiration and outward movement during expiration. The patient also exhibited labored breathing and reduced chest wall expansion. Radiographic findings indicated the presence of at least two fractures per rib in two ribs, along with sternum involvement, meeting the diagnostic criteria for flail chest. Given the extent of the injury and the respiratory compromise, ventilatory support may be necessary.",
  "Flail chest_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 45-year-old female patient, with a history of osteoporosis, presented with a persistent, localized chest pain (rated 6/10) following a fall at home. The pain worsens during deep breathing and is associated with respiratory difficulty. Physical examination revealed paradoxical movement of the chest wall, with inward motion during inspiration and outward motion during expiration. Imaging studies showed the presence of at least two fractures per rib in multiple ribs, meeting the diagnostic criteria for flail chest. The patient's reduced pulmonary function and the requirement for analgesics to manage the pain underscore the impact of this condition on her respiratory health.",
  "Flail chest_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 70-year-old male, with a significant smoking history, was brought to the emergency department after a crush injury in a work-related accident. The patient complained of severe chest pain (rated 9/10), exacerbated by breathing and movement. On examination, there was visible paradoxical movement of the chest wall, with in-drawing during inspiration and outward motion during expiration. The patient exhibited respiratory compromise, with shallow, rapid breathing. Radiographic findings revealed the involvement of the sternum and the presence of large flail segments, consistent with the diagnosis of flail chest. Given the extent of the injury and the patient's respiratory distress, urgent ventilatory support may be required to ensure adequate oxygenation."
