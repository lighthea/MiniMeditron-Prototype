  "Advanced breast cancer_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 57-year-old female with a history of early-stage breast cancer, initially treated with lumpectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy, presented with progressively worsening symptoms. She reported new, unrelenting bone pain localized in her axial skeleton and proximal limb bones, which she rated as 7/10 on the pain scale. Imaging studies revealed the presence of extensive bone metastases, increasing her risk of pathological fractures. Additionally, there was evidence of visceral metastases. The patient's ER and HER2 receptor status had changed, prompting the need for a re-evaluation of her treatment plan. She expressed a strong preference for detailed information regarding her condition and a high level of involvement in decision-making.",
  "Advanced breast cancer_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 45-year-old woman, previously diagnosed with breast cancer and treated with mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy, presented with concerning symptoms. She described persistent bone pain in her axial skeleton and limbs, scoring it at 6/10 in intensity. Imaging studies confirmed the presence of bone metastases, with an increased risk of pathological fractures in the proximal limb bones. There was also evidence of visceral metastases. Notably, a change in her oestrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor 2 receptor (HER2) status was observed, likely impacting her ongoing management. The patient expressed a preference for comprehensive and detailed information about her condition and treatment options.",
  "Advanced breast cancer_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 60-year-old woman with a history of early-stage breast cancer, treated with lumpectomy and adjuvant hormonal therapy, presented with a new set of symptoms. She reported persistent bone pain in her axial skeleton and proximal limb bones, which she rated at 5/10 in severity. Imaging studies revealed the presence of bone metastases, along with evidence of visceral metastases. Furthermore, there had been a change in her oestrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor 2 receptor (HER2) status, necessitating a re-evaluation of her treatment plan. The patient expressed a preference for detailed information regarding her condition and a moderate level of involvement in decision-making."
