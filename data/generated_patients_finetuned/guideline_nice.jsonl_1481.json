  "Keratoconus, Pellucid marginal degeneration_1": "    Patient A, a 35-year-old male, with a notable history of frequent eye rubbing, presented with a gradual decline in visual acuity over the past two years. He reported persistent blurriness, especially in low-light conditions, coupled with increased sensitivity to light (photophobia) and frequent changes in his eyeglass prescription due to astigmatism. Ophthalmic examination revealed high levels of astigmatism, consistent with irregular corneal shape. Additionally, the patient reported intermittent episodes of mild to moderate ocular discomfort (pain score 2-5/10) and a sensation of \"strained\" vision. Further diagnostic assessment, considering the degree of corneal irregularity and thinning, is warranted to determine the precise nature and extent of the corneal pathology.",
  "Keratoconus, Pellucid marginal degeneration_2": "    Patient B, a 28-year-old female, sought medical evaluation for visual disturbances and episodes of sudden blurriness in her right eye. She described the blurriness as intermittent, often accompanied by a transient, sharp pain (pain score 4-6/10) in the affected eye. Despite using corrective lenses, she continued to experience visual impairment, particularly in low-contrast environments. Ophthalmic examination revealed marked astigmatism and an irregular corneal shape in the right eye. The patient also reported a sensation of 'burning' in her eye during episodes of blurriness. Given the observed symptoms and the contextual factors, a comprehensive assessment is essential to delineate the underlying etiology and assess the extent of corneal involvement.",
  "Keratoconus, Pellucid marginal degeneration_3": "    Patient C, a 42-year-old individual, with a family history of ocular diseases, presented with a chronic, progressive visual decline in both eyes, which had been ongoing for the past five years. The patient reported persistent blurriness, frequent changes in eyeglass prescription due to astigmatism, and difficulty in achieving clear vision, especially at night. Ophthalmic examination revealed a high degree of astigmatism and an irregular corneal shape in both eyes. The patient also described episodes of ocular discomfort, characterized by a dull, aching pain (pain score 3-7/10) and a feeling of eye strain, which often worsened in the evening. Given the chronicity of symptoms and the family history, a thorough diagnostic workup is imperative to ascertain the underlying cause and assess the degree of corneal irregularity and thinning."
