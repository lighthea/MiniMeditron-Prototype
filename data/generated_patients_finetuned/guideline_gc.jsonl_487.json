  "Acute Diverticulitis_1": "    --- Patient Description 1 ---\n    A 48-year-old male, with a notable prior history of acute diverticulitis, presented with a localized, persistent, and mildly uncomfortable pain in the left lower quadrant of his abdomen. The patient reported an ongoing episode of vomiting and exhibited elevated CRP levels. Given his immunocompetence and the presence of high-risk features, including abscesses on imaging, there is a heightened concern for a complicated course of the disease. The patient's mild symptoms, coupled with the contextual factors of recurrent diverticulitis and his immunocompromised status, necessitate a comprehensive diagnostic approach to determine the extent of the condition and guide appropriate management.",
  "Acute Diverticulitis_2": "    --- Patient Description 2 ---\n    A 55-year-old female patient, known for her symptomatic diverticular disease impacting her quality of life, has presented with a recurrent episode of left lower quadrant abdominal pain. The pain, which she described as moderate (5/10 on the pain scale), is accompanied by vomiting. Elevated CRP levels further support the clinical suspicion. Given the patient's history, the diagnostic process must consider the risk factors for recurrent diverticulitis, as well as the impact of her comorbidities, including a history of diabetes and obesity. Institutional protocols and antibiotic stewardship principles should guide the assessment and management in this case to ensure an optimal outcome.",
  "Acute Diverticulitis_3": "    --- Patient Description 3 ---\n    In the emergency department, a 60-year-old male patient, who is immunosuppressed, presented with sudden-onset, severe (8/10 on the pain scale) abdominal pain localized to the left lower quadrant. The pain is accompanied by vomiting, and the patient exhibits hemodynamic instability. Elevated CRP levels were noted upon initial assessment. Imaging studies revealed the presence of free air and peri-colic air, raising concerns about perforated diverticulitis with diffuse peritonitis (Hinchey III/IV). The patient's immunosuppressed status adds complexity to the diagnostic and management process, demanding a swift and decisive approach to address this critical condition."
