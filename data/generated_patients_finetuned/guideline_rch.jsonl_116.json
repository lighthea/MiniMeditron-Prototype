  "Acute Cerebellar Ataxia_1": "    Description 1:\n    A 7-year-old male patient, with a history of recent varicella infection, presented with a notable onset of gait ataxia, rated at 4/10 in severity, and mild dysarthria. The ataxia is symmetrical and has progressively worsened over the past 5 days. On examination, the presence of nystagmus was observed. The patient's prodromal illness, in this case, the varicella infection, aligns with the typical 5-10 day interval preceding the onset of symptoms. These findings suggest a strong association with Acute Cerebellar Ataxia, commonly linked to varicella but can also be caused by other viral infections.",
  "Acute Cerebellar Ataxia_2": "    Description 2:\n    A 6-year-old female patient, without a significant medical history, developed symmetrical gait ataxia associated with mild dysarthria and nystagmus. The patient's ataxia, rated at 6/10 in severity, commenced 7 days after an episode of febrile illness, which was not attributed to a specific infectious agent. The ataxia has persisted and progressed over the past 3 days. The observed temporal relationship between the prodromal illness and the onset of ataxia, along with the presence of nystagmus, is indicative of Acute Cerebellar Ataxia. The etiology of the prodromal illness in this case remains undetermined.",
  "Acute Cerebellar Ataxia_3": "    Description 3:\n    A 5-year-old male patient, with a history of recent Mycoplasma infection, presented with symmetrical gait ataxia, rated at 5/10 in severity, along with nystagmus. The ataxia began 8 days after the resolution of the prodromal illness and has shown a progressive worsening over the past week. The mycoplasma infection serves as the prodromal event preceding the onset of ataxia, aligning with the typical 5-10 day interval. These clinical findings are consistent with Acute Cerebellar Ataxia, with mycoplasma infection as the inciting factor in this instance."
