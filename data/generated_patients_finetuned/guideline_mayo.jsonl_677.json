  "Muscular dystrophy_1": "    Patient A, a 9-year-old male, is being evaluated for a complex neuromuscular presentation. The child's parents report a concerning history of progressive muscle weakness, leading to frequent falls and difficulty in rising from a lying or sitting position. Physical examination reveals a waddling gait, walking on the toes, and notably enlarged calf muscles. The patient also experiences muscle pain and stiffness, further complicating his mobility. An assessment of the family history is significant for a male cousin with a similar, albeit undiagnosed, condition. These clinical findings, coupled with the age of onset and gender, underscore the importance of a comprehensive diagnostic workup to elucidate the underlying etiology of the patient's symptoms.",
  "Muscular dystrophy_2": "    Patient B, a 7-year-old female, presents with a perplexing constellation of neuromuscular manifestations. Her parents describe a history of progressive muscle weakness, which has led to recurrent falls and challenges in activities requiring running and jumping. Notably, the child exhibits a waddling gait and frequently walks on her toes. Physical examination reveals enlarged calf muscles and persistent muscle pain and stiffness. The patient's medical history is unremarkable, and there are no known familial neuromuscular disorders. However, the onset of symptoms and the patient's gender add complexity to the diagnostic process, necessitating a thorough evaluation to determine the underlying cause of her condition.",
  "Muscular dystrophy_3": "    Patient C, a 25-year-old male, seeks medical attention for a concerning neuromuscular phenotype. He reports a history of progressive muscle weakness, frequent falls, and persistent difficulty in rising from a lying or sitting position. The patient's mobility is further compromised by trouble running and jumping, as well as a noticeable waddling gait. Physical examination reveals enlarged calf muscles, along with muscle pain and stiffness. Notably, the patient has a family history of neuromuscular disorders, with his older brother being diagnosed with a similar condition. These clinical manifestations, coupled with the patient's age and gender, underscore the complexity of the diagnostic process and the need for a comprehensive evaluation to elucidate the underlying etiology of his symptoms.\n"
