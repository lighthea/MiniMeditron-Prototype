  "Patients requiring spinal precautions and cervical spine (C-spine) evaluation following trauma, Assessment, Diagnostic imaging or treatment situation requiring neutral C-spine alignment, Patients with achondroplasia or hydrocephalus, Patients with abnormally large head_1": "    Description 1: A 32-year-old male patient was brought into the emergency department following a motor vehicle accident. The patient presented with localized neck pain, which he described as severe (7/10 on the pain scale), and limited range of motion in the cervical spine. Additionally, he reported a tingling sensation in both arms. The assessment and diagnostic imaging of the patient's C-spine were indicated to rule out any potential injury. It is crucial to consider the patient's age, size, and the presence of trauma in determining the appropriate course of action for C-spine evaluation and management.",
  "Patients requiring spinal precautions and cervical spine (C-spine) evaluation following trauma, Assessment, Diagnostic imaging or treatment situation requiring neutral C-spine alignment, Patients with achondroplasia or hydrocephalus, Patients with abnormally large head_2": "    Description 2: A 5-month-old infant with a medical history of hydrocephalus was brought in for a routine follow-up examination. The patient's caregiver reported an increase in irritability and fussiness, especially during activities that involve movement or when the infant is picked up. The infant's head circumference was noted to be disproportionately large for their age. Given the presence of hydrocephalus and the abnormally large head, a comprehensive evaluation of the cervical spine is necessary to assess for any potential abnormalities or signs of compression, as per the spinal precautions and C-spine evaluation guidelines.",
  "Patients requiring spinal precautions and cervical spine (C-spine) evaluation following trauma, Assessment, Diagnostic imaging or treatment situation requiring neutral C-spine alignment, Patients with achondroplasia or hydrocephalus, Patients with abnormally large head_3": "    Description 3: A 45-year-old female patient, known to have achondroplasia, presented with chronic neck pain and stiffness. The pain was described as moderate (5/10 on the pain scale) and had been persistent for several months. The patient reported occasional numbness and tingling sensations in her hands, which she attributed to her neck discomfort. Given the underlying condition of achondroplasia, which can impact the skeletal structure, it is essential to conduct a comprehensive assessment and diagnostic imaging of the patient's cervical spine to evaluate the source of her symptoms and determine an appropriate treatment plan, considering the unique factors affecting diagnostic procedures in patients with this condition."
