  "Esthesioneuroblastoma_1": "  Case 1:\n  A 45-year-old male patient, with no significant medical history, presented with a constellation of concerning symptoms. He reported a gradual and complete loss of his sense of smell over the past six months, accompanied by frequent and recurrent nosebleeds. Additionally, he described difficulty breathing through his nose, which he attributed to a persistent stuffiness.
