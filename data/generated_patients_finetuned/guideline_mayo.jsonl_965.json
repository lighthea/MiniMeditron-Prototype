  "Stretch marks (striae)_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 25-year-old male patient, who has been using corticosteroid medicine for an extended period due to a chronic inflammatory condition, presented with a dermatological concern. He reported the sudden appearance of black and blue indented streaks on his abdomen and upper thighs. These streaks have caused mild itching and are a source of distress for the patient. The duration of corticosteroid use is a pertinent factor in this case, as it may influence the etiology of the observed skin changes.",
  "Stretch marks (striae)_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 38-year-old female patient with a history of Cushing syndrome sought medical evaluation for a dermatological issue. She described the presence of discolored streaks, ranging from black to purple, in various areas of her body, including the abdomen, breasts, and hips. The streaks, which had been progressively developing over the past two years, are of particular concern to the patient due to their unusual appearance and association with her underlying condition. The diagnostic process should take into account the patient's history of Cushing syndrome and the atypical nature of the observed stretch marks."
