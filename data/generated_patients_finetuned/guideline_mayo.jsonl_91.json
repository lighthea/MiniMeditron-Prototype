  "Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)_1": "    Description 1:\n    A 36-year-old patient, with a notable medical history of occasional heart palpitations, presented with recurrent episodes of a very rapid heartbeat, self-rated at 9/10 for severity, often accompanied by a persistent pounding sensation in the chest and neck. The palpitations were occasionally triggered by moderate exercise or stressful situations. The patient reported concomitant symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, and occasional lightheadedness during these episodes. Notably, there was no history of fainting or syncope. Given the recurrent nature of these symptoms and their impact on the patient's daily life, further diagnostic evaluation is warranted to determine the underlying etiology and guide appropriate management.",
  "Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)_2": "    Description 2:\n    A 45-year-old patient, without known cardiac conditions, presented with a concerning symptomatology. The patient described recurrent episodes of a pounding sensation in the chest and neck, associated with a very rapid heartbeat, rated at 8/10 for intensity. These episodes often occurred without a discernible trigger but were also reported during periods of increased stress or after sleep deprivation. The patient experienced notable palpitations and described a sensation of chest pain during these episodes, along with pronounced fatigue and sweating. Although there were no instances of fainting, the frequency and intensity of the symptoms prompted the patient to seek medical evaluation for further assessment and management.",
  "Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)_3": "    Description 3:\n    In the clinical setting, a 50-year-old patient with a history of occasional heart palpitations and no known cardiac conditions presented with bothersome symptoms. The patient reported recurrent, self-rated 7/10, very rapid heartbeat episodes, often accompanied by palpitations and a pounding sensation in the neck. Interestingly, these episodes were sometimes triggered by exercise or emotional stress, while at other times, they occurred spontaneously. The patient also described chest pain, along with feelings of fatigue, shortness of breath, and occasional lightheadedness. No history of fainting was noted. Given the impact of these symptoms on the patient's quality of life, a comprehensive diagnostic workup is essential to identify the underlying cause and determine the most appropriate treatment strategy."
