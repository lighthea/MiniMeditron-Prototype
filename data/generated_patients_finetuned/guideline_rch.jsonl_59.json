  "Asthma_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 42-year-old male with a history of smoking and occasional vaping presented with a persistent, productive cough that has been ongoing for the past two months. He reports a sensation of breathlessness, particularly when engaging in physical activities such as climbing stairs or walking briskly. The patient describes his wheezing as intermittent but has become more frequent in the last few weeks. He has been using his short-acting \u03b22-agonist (SABA) inhaler more than twice weekly. On physical examination, no clubbing or chest pain was noted. Given the patient's smoking history, along with the presence of wheeze, breathlessness, and a persistent cough, a comprehensive diagnostic workup is warranted to evaluate the underlying etiology of his respiratory symptoms.",
  "Asthma_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 35-year-old female, known for her history of allergic rhinitis and seasonal allergies, presented with a recurrent isolated cough, which she has been experiencing for the last three months. The cough is often paroxysmal and is not accompanied by sputum production. She reports intermittent episodes of wheezing, especially during the night and early morning hours. The patient has a family history of atopy. Despite being prescribed an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) as a preventer, she admits to infrequent use and poor adherence to the prescribed regimen. Her inhaler technique was found to be suboptimal during the assessment. There is no history of smoking or occupational exposure. Given the presence of cough, wheeze, and a documented allergic rhinitis, a thorough evaluation of her respiratory symptoms and treatment adherence is imperative.",
  "Asthma_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 55-year-old male, obese and with a known history of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), presented with chronic, persistent wheezing and breathlessness that has been progressively worsening over the past six months. The patient's symptoms are notably exacerbated at night, disrupting his sleep. He reports using his SABA inhaler more than thrice weekly. Upon further inquiry, he discloses a history of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) that is inadequately controlled. The physical examination reveals no clubbing, but the patient's BMI is in the obese range. His spirometry results indicate a significant reversible airflow obstruction. Given the constellation of symptoms, including obesity, OSA, GERD, and the documented use of SABA, a comprehensive diagnostic approach is essential to address his respiratory issues.\n"
