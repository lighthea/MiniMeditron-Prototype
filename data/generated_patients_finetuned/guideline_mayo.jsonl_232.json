  "Cleft lip and cleft palate_1": "    Patient A, a 3-month-old infant, was brought in by the parents with concerns of feeding difficulties. The infant exhibits a notable split in the lip, extending from the upper gum into the bottom of the nose. This has resulted in challenges during feedings, as observed by recurrent choking episodes and the tendency for milk to regurgitate through the nose during breastfeeding. The parents also reported a nasal quality in the infant's voice. Notably, there is no family history of cleft lip or palate, and the mother did not report exposure to known risk factors during pregnancy. The infant's weight gain has been suboptimal, raising additional concerns. Further evaluation is warranted to assess the full extent of the orofacial cleft and its impact on the infant's feeding and development.",
  "Cleft lip and cleft palate_2": "    Patient B, a 7-year-old child, presented with a history of recurrent ear infections and chronic nasal speaking voice. On examination, a visible split in the lip and roof of the mouth (palate) was noted, affecting the left side of the face. The child has been experiencing difficulty swallowing, with reports of liquids and foods occasionally emanating from the nose during meals. This has led to frustration and social challenges for the child. Notably, there is no family history of cleft lip or palate. The parents denied exposure to known risk factors during pregnancy. The recurrent ear infections have necessitated multiple courses of antibiotics. A comprehensive evaluation is essential to address the structural anomalies and their impact on the child's speech, swallowing, and ear health.",
  "Cleft lip and cleft palate_3": "    Patient C, a 1-year-old toddler, was brought in for an assessment of a split in the lip and the roof of the mouth (palate) affecting both sides of the face. The parents reported difficulties with feedings since birth, including excessive spillage of liquids and solids through the cleft. The toddler's feeding issues have contributed to below-average weight gain. Additionally, the parents observed a split in the lip, appearing as a small notch on the left side. There is a family history of cleft lip and palate, with a first-degree relative also affected. The mother did not report exposure to known risk factors during pregnancy. A comprehensive evaluation is crucial to address the feeding challenges, promote weight gain, and assess the extent of the orofacial cleft in this young patient."
