  "Haemophilia_1": "    Patient A, a 35-year-old male, presented with a concerning medical history marked by recurrent episodes of bleeding. He reported frequent joint bleeds, particularly in his knees, with a pain level ranging from 6 to 8 on a scale of 10. Additionally, he experienced muscle bleeds, notably in his upper arms and calves. These symptoms have persisted over the past two years, despite conservative treatments such as rest and ice application. Laboratory investigations revealed a notable deficiency in Factor VIII, further complicating the diagnostic process. The presence of Factor VIII deficiency, along with the recurrent joint and muscle bleeds, suggests a compelling case for a comprehensive evaluation to determine the underlying etiology of the patient's condition.",
  "Haemophilia_2": "    Patient B, a 25-year-old female, presented with a complex medical history characterized by frequent episodes of bleeding. She reported recurrent mucosal bleeding, particularly from her gums and nose, with an associated pain level of 4 to 6. These symptoms have been ongoing for the past five years and have significantly impacted her quality of life. Notably, the patient has a family history of haemophilia. Laboratory investigations revealed a deficiency in Factor IX, further contributing to the diagnostic challenges. The presence of mucosal bleeding, coupled with the documented Factor IX deficiency and the patient's family history, underscores the need for an in-depth diagnostic assessment to delineate the underlying nature of her condition.",
  "Haemophilia_3": "    Patient C, a 40-year-old male, presented with a history of persistent bleeding episodes. He reported recurrent joint bleeds, predominantly in his ankles and elbows, with a pain level ranging from 5 to 7. These symptoms have been ongoing for the past three years and have not shown significant improvement with standard conservative measures. The patient also exhibited signs of iron deficiency, further complicating the diagnostic process. Laboratory tests confirmed a notable deficiency in Factor VIII/IX, adding complexity to the clinical evaluation. The presence of joint bleeds, coupled with the documented Factor VIII/IX deficiency and iron deficiency, necessitates a comprehensive diagnostic workup to elucidate the underlying pathology contributing to the patient's condition."
