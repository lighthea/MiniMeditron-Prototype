  "Diabetes insipidus (DI)_1": "  Description 1:\n    A 17-year-old male patient, with no prior medical history, presented with a constellation of symptoms, including debilitating polyuria and nocturia, with a frequency of 20 episodes per day and 5 episodes per night, significantly disrupting his sleep. The patient reported an insatiable polydipsia, consuming over 6 liters of water per day. Despite his increased fluid intake, he has experienced an unintentional 8% loss of body weight over the last 3 months. There is no history of head injury or intercurrent illness. The patient's neurological examination revealed no focal deficits, but he reported constipation. A comprehensive review of his medications showed no potential etiology for his symptoms, and there are no underlying diseases. Given his age and the presence of polyuria, nocturia, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss, a diagnostic workup is warranted to explore the possibility of Diabetes Insipidus.",
  "Diabetes insipidus (DI)_2": "   Description 2:\n    A 32-year-old female patient, known to have a medical history of postpartum hemorrhage 2 years ago, presented with a 6-month history of polyuria and new-onset nocturnal enuresis, with a frequency of 15 episodes per day and 4 episodes per night. She reported a persistent polydipsia, requiring her to drink over 5 liters of water daily. The patient noted a gradual, unintentional weight loss of 10% during this period. She denied any recent head injury, and there is no current intercurrent illness. The physical examination was unremarkable, except for constipation. Her medical history revealed that she was not on any medications. The presence of these symptoms, along with her history of postpartum hemorrhage, underscores the need for a thorough diagnostic evaluation to assess the possibility of Diabetes Insipidus.",
  "Diabetes insipidus (DI)_3": "   Description 3:\n    A 45-year-old male patient with a history of traumatic brain injury following a motor vehicle accident 3 months ago presented with polyuria, nocturia, and polydipsia. He reported 12 episodes of urination per day and 3 episodes per night, along with a notable increase in fluid intake, necessitating 4 liters of water daily. The patient had experienced a gradual weight loss of 6% since the injury. His symptoms were not associated with any intercurrent illness, and his neurological examination revealed mild residual deficits from the head injury. He also reported constipation. The review of his medications did not reveal any potential causes for his condition. Given the history of head injury and the presence of polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss, a comprehensive diagnostic assessment is essential to investigate the likelihood of Diabetes Insipidus as a consequence of the traumatic brain injury."
