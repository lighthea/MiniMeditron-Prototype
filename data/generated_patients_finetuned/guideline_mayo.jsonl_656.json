  "Molluscum contagiosum_1": "    Patient A, a 7-year-old child, was brought in by the parents due to the concern of multiple raised, round, and skin-colored bumps on the face, trunk, and arms. The lesions, each smaller than 6mm in diameter, are typically accompanied by itching, and some exhibit a small dent or dot at the center. The child has no significant medical history, and there are no known factors affecting the diagnostic process. The family has tried over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream with minimal relief. The presented symptoms are consistent with a dermatological condition characterized by molluscum contagiosum.",
  "Molluscum contagiosum_2": "    Patient B, a 28-year-old adult, sought medical attention for the presence of small, itchy, pink bumps on the lower abdomen, inner thighs, and genital area. These raised, round skin lesions, some of which have a small dent or dot at the top, are notably smaller than 6mm in diameter. The patient reported a recent history of unprotected sexual activity. There are no other pertinent medical issues affecting the diagnostic evaluation. The described symptoms align with an adult presentation of molluscum contagiosum, likely due to a sexually transmitted infection.",
  "Molluscum contagiosum_3": "    Patient C, a 4-year-old child, was brought in with a chief complaint of multiple raised, round, and itchy skin-colored bumps on the trunk and legs. These small lesions, each with a noticeable small dent or dot at the top, are smaller than 6mm in diameter. The child has no significant medical history, and there are no unusual factors affecting the diagnostic process. The family has not attempted any prior treatments. The observed symptoms are indicative of molluscum contagiosum, a common viral skin condition in pediatric patients."
