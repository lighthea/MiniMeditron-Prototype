  "Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome_1": "    Doctor's Description 1:\n    A 42-year-old male patient with a history of lung transplantation presented with a persistent, dry cough that has been ongoing for the past three months. The cough is accompanied by dyspnoea on exertion, and the patient reports a noticeable decline in his energy levels, attributing it to increasing fatigue. Notably, the patient has experienced a decline in his forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) readings. Despite chronic immunosuppressive therapy that includes cyclosporine, the decline in respiratory function persists. These clinical findings, along with the patient's transplant history, raise concerns regarding the possibility of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome.",
  "Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome_2": "    Doctor's Description 2:\n    A 36-year-old female patient, post lung transplantation, presented with dyspnoea and new-onset cough, which she describes as dry and persistent. The patient reports a gradual decline in her exercise tolerance and a persistent feeling of fatigue. Pulmonary function tests reveal a significant decrease in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). The patient has a documented history of non-minimal acute cellular rejection on transbronchial lung biopsy specimens. These clinical findings, along with the patient's transplant history and the presence of rejection on biopsy, strongly suggest the possibility of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome.",
  "Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome_3": "    Doctor's Description 3:\n    A 55-year-old male patient, who underwent lung transplantation, presented with a persistent, new-onset cough and dyspnoea. The cough is non-productive and has been present for the last two months. The patient reports a noticeable decline in his exercise tolerance and increased fatigue. Notably, there has been a documented decline in his forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) readings. The patient also has a history of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR). The combination of clinical symptoms, decline in FEV1, and the presence of GOR raises concerns regarding the potential diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome."
