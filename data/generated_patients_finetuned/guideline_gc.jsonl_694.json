  "Hodgkin lymphoma_1": "    Description 1:\n    A 28-year-old female patient with a history of recurrent respiratory infections presented with painless, enlarged lymph nodes in the neck and armpits, which have been persisting for the past three months. The patient reported a sporadic low-grade fever, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss of 10 pounds over the last six months. She has no history of infectious mononucleosis or tuberculosis. Physical examination revealed rubbery, nontender lymph nodes. The patient's overall performance status is relatively good, with only mild fatigue (1-2/10) and occasional night sweats. Given the presence of unfavorable risk factors and the constellation of symptoms, further diagnostic workup, including lymph node biopsy, is warranted to determine the underlying etiology.",
  "Hodgkin lymphoma_2": "    Description 2:\n    A 34-year-old male patient, a former smoker, presented with a two-month history of a persistent, painless swelling in the left supraclavicular area, along with intermittent drenching night sweats and unexplained weight loss of 15 pounds over the last four months. The patient reported no recent respiratory or systemic infections. Physical examination revealed palpable, nontender lymphadenopathy in the neck and left supraclavicular region. The patient is experiencing moderate fatigue (3-4/10) and has noticed a decreased exercise tolerance. Given the presentation of Stage III-IV cHL in a patient with a history of smoking, a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including imaging studies and lymph node biopsy, is essential to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the disease involvement.",
  "Hodgkin lymphoma_3": "    Description 3:\n    A 22-year-old male patient presented with a two-month history of painless lumps in the neck and groin areas, accompanied by persistent low-grade fevers and night sweats. The patient reported a 12-pound unintentional weight loss over the last six months. He denied any previous history of similar symptoms or significant infectious episodes. Physical examination revealed multiple enlarged, nontender lymph nodes in the affected regions. The patient's performance status is relatively good, but he experiences frequent night sweats and mild itching (2/10). Given the presence of Stage I-II cHL with favorable risk in a young patient, a thorough diagnostic workup, including lymph node biopsy and imaging studies, is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the most appropriate treatment plan."
