  "Meningitis_1": "    Description 1:\n    A 16-month-old male patient, with a recent history of upper respiratory tract infection, was brought in by his parents due to concerning symptoms. The child is experiencing a persistent high-grade fever (100.9\u00b0F) and severe headache, as reported by the parents. Furthermore, the patient's neck stiffness was noted during the physical examination, along with photophobia. The altered mental state was observed, with the child being more lethargic than usual. It's important to highlight the age factor in the diagnostic process. Given the patient's young age and the presence of these symptoms, the diagnostic evaluation is crucial in discerning the underlying etiology.",
  "Meningitis_2": "    Description 2:\n    A 35-year-old male patient presented with a complex medical history, including chronic sinusitis, for which he received multiple courses of antibiotics in the past year. The patient described a progressively worsening headache, which he rated as 7/10 in severity, associated with a high-grade fever. Physical examination revealed pronounced neck stiffness and photophobia. The patient also reported an altered mental state, experiencing confusion and difficulty focusing. The presence of the aforementioned symptoms, coupled with the history of recurrent antibiotic use, poses a challenge in the diagnostic process and warrants a comprehensive evaluation.",
  "Meningitis_3": "    Description 3:\n    A 25-year-old female patient, without significant past medical history, reported to the clinic with a severe headache (8/10 in intensity) and persistent high fever. The headache was accompanied by neck stiffness and photophobia, further complicating the patient's condition. Additionally, the patient exhibited an altered mental state, as reported by her family, with episodes of confusion and irritability. The absence of recent antibiotic treatment and the patient's age contribute to the complexity of the diagnostic assessment. A thorough evaluation is essential to determine the underlying cause of the presenting symptoms."
