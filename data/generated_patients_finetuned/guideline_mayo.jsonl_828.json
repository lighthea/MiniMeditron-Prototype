  "Proctitis_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    \n    A 32-year-old male patient, with a history of inflammatory bowel disease, presented with troubling symptoms. He reported a persistent, urgent need to have a bowel movement, often accompanied by rectal bleeding and the passage of mucus. The patient described his rectal pain as 6/10 in severity and localized discomfort on the left side of his abdomen. Additionally, he experienced a feeling of fullness in his rectum and episodes of diarrhea, further exacerbating his distress. Given his medical history, the presence of these symptoms raises concerns regarding the progression of his inflammatory bowel disease and necessitates a comprehensive evaluation.",
  "Proctitis_3": "    A 45-year-old female patient, with a history of pelvic radiation therapy for cancer, presented with concerning gastrointestinal symptoms. She reported a frequent sensation of needing to have a bowel movement, accompanied by rectal bleeding and the passage of mucus through her rectum. The patient described her rectal pain as 5/10 in intensity and noted a persistent feeling of fullness in her rectum. She also reported episodes of diarrhea and left-sided abdominal pain. These symptoms, in the context of her medical history of radiation therapy, raise the suspicion of radiation-induced proctitis and warrant a thorough diagnostic assessment.",
