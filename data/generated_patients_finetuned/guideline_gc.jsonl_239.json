  "Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)_2": "Patient Description 1:\nA 9-year-old girl, previously healthy, is presenting with persistent joint pain, rated at 6/10 in intensity, primarily affecting her knees and wrists. The pain is associated with swelling and warmth in the affected joints, along with noticeable stiffness, especially in the morning or after prolonged periods of inactivity. These symptoms have been ongoing for the past 3 months, and despite the use of over-the-counter analgesics, there has been no significant relief. The involvement of multiple joints and the presence of systemic symptoms such as intermittent low-grade fevers and fatigue are noteworthy. Given the age of onset, number of joints involved, and the systemic manifestations, a comprehensive evaluation is warranted to determine the underlying etiology of her debilitating symptoms.",
  "Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)_3": "Patient Description 2:\nA 14-year-old adolescent male, with no previous significant medical history, has been experiencing joint pain and swelling, predominantly in his ankles and the small joints of his hands. The pain, rated at 5/10, is frequently accompanied by visible swelling, warmth, and a persistent feeling of stiffness in the affected joints. He reports a limited range of motion in these joints, particularly after physical activities. Despite attempts at using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the symptoms have persisted for over 4 months. The age of onset, the pattern of joint involvement, and the absence of an alternate explanation for his symptoms raise concerns, necessitating a comprehensive diagnostic assessment to elucidate the underlying pathology.",
  "Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)_4": "Patient Description 3:\nA 7-year-old boy, with a family history of autoimmune conditions, is presenting with joint pain and swelling affecting his elbows, knees, and ankles. The pain, rated at 7/10, is often associated with noticeable warmth and stiffness in the affected joints, particularly in the morning and after periods of rest. His parents have observed a limited range of motion in these joints, and the symptoms have persisted for approximately 2 months, despite the use of over-the-counter pain medications. Additionally, the presence of intermittent low-grade fevers and fatigue is noted. Given the age of onset, the pattern of joint involvement, and the family history, a comprehensive diagnostic workup is crucial in determining the nature of his condition and providing appropriate management."
