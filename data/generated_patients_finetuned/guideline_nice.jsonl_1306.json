  "Spasticity in cerebral palsy_1": "    Patient A, a 7-year-old child with a known history of cerebral palsy, presents with a constellation of symptoms consistent with spasticity. The patient demonstrates abnormalities in movement, balance, and posture, which notably impact their ability to walk and sit independently. Moreover, the child experiences recurrent discomfort, cramps, and spasms, further compounding their motor difficulties. Despite prior non-pharmacological interventions such as physical therapy, the spasticity-related symptoms persist, significantly influencing the patient's functional abilities and quality of life.",
  "Spasticity in cerebral palsy_2": "    Patient B, a 9-year-old with a documented history of cerebral palsy, is exhibiting pronounced spasticity-related symptoms. The child's movement, balance, and posture are notably abnormal, contributing to impaired walking and sitting. Furthermore, the patient frequently experiences discomfort, cramps, and spasms, which have been escalating in frequency and intensity. Despite previous attempts at non-pharmacological interventions, including orthotic devices and stretching exercises, the spasticity-related symptoms continue to impact the child's daily activities and overall well-being.",
  "Spasticity in cerebral palsy_3": "    Patient C, a 6-year-old with a confirmed diagnosis of cerebral palsy, presents with significant spasticity-related symptoms. The child displays abnormalities in movement, balance, and posture, which have led to impaired walking and sitting abilities. Additionally, the patient reports recurrent discomfort, cramps, and spasms, with a notable impact on their daily life. Despite adherence to previous non-pharmacological measures, such as assistive walking devices and regular physical therapy, the spasticity-related symptoms persist and have been increasingly bothersome to the child. A comprehensive assessment is warranted to address the ongoing impact of spasticity on the patient's functional capacity and comfort."
