  "Hepatocellular carcinoma_2": " A 57-year-old male patient, with a history of chronic hepatitis B, presents with a tender, palpable mass in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. He describes intermittent dull pain at this location, which he rates at 5/10 on the pain scale. There are also episodes of low-grade fever. On examination, hepatomegaly is noted, and imaging reveals a single large liver tumor. Given the presence of residual disease in the form of a solitary tumor, further diagnostic workup is warranted to determine the nature and extent of the hepatic lesion.",
  "Hepatocellular carcinoma_4": "An 64-year-old female patient, with a known history of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), reports persistent, vague abdominal discomfort in the right upper quadrant, which she rates at 4/10 on the pain scale. She has unintentional weight loss of 10 pounds over the past two months despite maintaining her usual diet. Physical examination reveals hepatomegaly, and imaging studies show multiple, variably sized liver lesions. The number and distribution of these malignant liver tumors, along with the patient's clinical presentation, necessitate a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to assess the extent of the disease and available treatment options.",
  "Hepatocellular carcinoma_6": "A 72-year-old male patient, with a remote history of alcohol abuse, presents with aching pain (7/10 in intensity) in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, which has been progressively worsening over the past six months. He has also noticed a yellowish discoloration of the skin and generalized weakness. On examination, he exhibits jaundice, hepatomegaly, and evidence of weight loss. Imaging studies reveal a large, dominant tumor in the liver. The presence of a single, substantial liver tumor, in the context of the patient's history and symptoms, underscores the need for a comprehensive diagnostic assessment to determine the nature and distribution of the malignancy."
