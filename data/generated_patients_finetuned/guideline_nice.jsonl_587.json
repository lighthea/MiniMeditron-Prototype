  "Type 2 diabetes_2": "    A 54-year-old male patient, with a known history of type 2 diabetes, presented with inadequate glycaemic control despite being on a regimen of metformin and a DPP-4 inhibitor. He reported a gradual weight gain of 8 pounds over the past two months, which he found concerning. The patient expressed occasional episodes of hypoglycaemia, accompanied by sweating and dizziness, with a self-reported pain level of 5/10 during these episodes. His lifestyle is characterized by irregular meal timing and minimal exercise due to work commitments. Given his intolerance to metformin, the treatment plan needs to be carefully reassessed to address both the inadequate glycaemic control and the associated risk of hypoglycaemia and weight gain.",
  "Type 2 diabetes_4": "    A 62-year-old female patient, newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, presented with a complex clinical picture. She had a history of intolerance to metformin, experiencing gastrointestinal disturbances, which led to its discontinuation after a brief trial. The patient reported a notable weight gain of 15 pounds within three months despite dietary modifications, and her glycaemic control remained inadequate. Furthermore, she had two episodes of hypoglycaemia, associated with confusion and irritability, with a reported pain level of 6/10 during these events. The patient's lifestyle is sedentary, and there is a family history of diabetes. This case necessitates a tailored treatment approach that addresses glycaemic control, weight management, and the risk of hypoglycaemia, taking into account the intolerance to metformin and the observed weight gain.",
  "Type 2 diabetes_6": "    A 45-year-old male patient, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, presented with suboptimal glycaemic control while on metformin and a DPP-4 inhibitor. He described a gradual weight gain of 10 pounds over the last four months, despite adherence to dietary recommendations and increased physical activity. The patient reported recurrent hypoglycaemic episodes, associated with palpitations and anxiety, and rated the pain during these episodes as 4/10. Notably, he has a history of alcohol use disorder, which has been challenging to manage. This lifestyle factor may contribute to the observed symptoms. Given the patient's contraindications to metformin due to renal impairment, the treatment strategy needs to be reevaluated to address inadequate glycaemic control, weight management, and the risk of hypoglycaemia, taking into consideration his renal function and lifestyle challenges."
