  "Diarrhea_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 7-year-old child, with no significant medical history, presents with a five-day history of recurrent loose, watery stools (8-10 times/day) and abdominal cramps. The patient's parents noted a low-grade fever (100.4\u00b0F) and an urgent need to have a bowel movement. The child's condition has led to mild dehydration, which has been managed with oral rehydration solutions at home. There is no history of recent travel or medication use. The presence of fever, abdominal pain, and prolonged duration of symptoms raises concerns that necessitate a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.",
  "Diarrhea_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 35-year-old male patient, with a history of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), presents with a two-week history of diarrhea. The patient describes loose, watery stools (5-6 times/day) with associated abdominal bloating and cramps. There is no reported blood in the stool, but the frequency of bowel movements has significantly increased. The patient reports occasional nausea but no vomiting. Given the known history of IBS, the diagnostic process should aim to differentiate whether the current symptoms represent a flare-up of IBS or an alternative etiology.",
  "Diarrhea_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 50-year-old female patient, with no significant medical history, reports persistent diarrhea that has lasted for ten days. She experiences frequent loose, watery stools (6-8 times/day) and has noticed mucus in the stool. The patient also describes abdominal cramps and a sense of urgency before bowel movements. There is no history of fever, vomiting, or blood in the stool. However, the prolonged duration of symptoms, along with the presence of mucus in the stool, warrants a thorough diagnostic assessment to determine the underlying cause of her diarrhea."
