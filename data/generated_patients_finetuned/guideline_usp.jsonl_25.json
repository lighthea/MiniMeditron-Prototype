  "Chlamydia and Gonorrhea_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 20-year-old male college student presents with a complaint of testicular pain, which he rates at 8 on a scale of 10 in intensity, along with a unilateral scrotal swelling. The pain has been persistent for two weeks and is not relieved by over-the-counter analgesics. The patient reports a recent history of unprotected sexual intercourse.
