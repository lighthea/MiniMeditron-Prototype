  "Acute Liver Failure_1": "     Patient Description 1:\n     A 42-year-old male patient, with a history of alcohol abuse, was admitted to the hospital with a constellation of concerning symptoms. He presented with an altered mental status, characterized by advanced-grade encephalopathy, including confusion, somnolence, and disorientation. The clinical assessment also revealed signs of hyperammonemia, with elevated ammonia levels. The patient's encephalopathy has rapidly progressed, and he now exhibits features of intracranial hypertension. Despite the administration of lactulose and rifaximin in the past for his hepatic encephalopathy, the symptoms have worsened. The diagnostic process is challenging due to the need for invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring. However, given the patient's history and the observed symptoms, urgent intervention and definitive management are imperative.",
  "Acute Liver Failure_2": "     Patient Description 2:\n     A 35-year-old female patient, without any known history of liver disease, presented with severe and persistent symptoms. She is experiencing advanced-grade encephalopathy, as evidenced by profound confusion, agitation, and altered behavior. The clinical examination also revealed marked hyperammonemia, further complicating the patient's condition. Despite the initiation of treatment with lactulose, rifaximin, and flumazenil, her encephalopathy has worsened, culminating in intracranial hypertension. The diagnostic process is hindered by the need for invasive ICP monitoring. The patient's medical history lacks any predisposing factors for liver disease, posing a challenge in determining the underlying cause of her acute liver failure.",
  "Acute Liver Failure_3": "     Patient Description 3:\n     A 50-year-old male patient, with a history of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, presented to the emergency department with a complex clinical picture. He exhibits advanced-grade encephalopathy, with high-grade confusion and impaired cognitive function. Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of hyperammonemia, indicative of severe hepatic dysfunction. Despite prior interventions with branch-chain amino acids, carnitine, and zinc supplementation for his underlying liver disease, the patient's encephalopathy has progressed rapidly, leading to intracranial hypertension. The diagnostic process is further complicated by the need for invasive ICP monitoring. Given the patient's history of liver disease, the management strategy must address the acute liver failure and its associated complications effectively."
