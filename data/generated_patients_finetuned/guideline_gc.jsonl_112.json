  "Chronic Spinal Pain_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 45-year-old male patient presented with chronic spinal pain, primarily localized to the lumbar region. The pain is characterized as dull and achy, with intermittent episodes of sharp, shooting sensations that radiate down the back of his right leg, rated at 7/10 on the pain scale. The onset of symptoms was gradual, and the patient reported an unsuccessful history of conservative management, including physical therapy and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Physical examination revealed reduced lumbar range of motion and tenderness over the L4-L5 region. Given the failure of conservative management and the specific nature of the pain, further diagnostic evaluation using fluoroscopic or CT guidance may be warranted to determine the underlying etiology of the patient's chronic spinal pain.",
  "Chronic Spinal Pain_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 55-year-old female patient with a history of chronic spinal pain presented for evaluation of her ongoing symptoms. The patient described her pain as a constant, deep ache in the thoracic region, accompanied by occasional burning and tingling sensations, rated at 6/10 in intensity. She reported a prolonged course of conservative management with limited success, including the use of physical therapy and analgesic medications. Physical examination revealed tenderness and reduced thoracic spine mobility. The patient expressed frustration with the persistent nature of her pain, which has significantly impacted her daily activities. Given the chronicity of her symptoms, along with the failure of conservative management, further diagnostic assessment using fluoroscopic or CT guidance may be necessary to elucidate the underlying cause of her spinal pain.",
  "Chronic Spinal Pain_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 35-year-old male patient presented with chronic spinal pain, predominantly localized to the cervical region. The pain was described as aching and burning, with intermittent episodes of sharp, shooting pain radiating into both arms, rated at 8/10 in severity. The onset of symptoms was insidious, and the patient reported an extensive history of failed conservative management, including physical therapy and oral pain medications. Physical examination revealed reduced range of motion in the cervical spine and tenderness over the C5-C6 vertebrae. The patient's occupational duties, which involve prolonged desk work and frequent computer use, have exacerbated his symptoms and led to significant functional impairment. Given the severity of the pain, as well as the failure of conservative management, further diagnostic evaluation using fluoroscopic or CT guidance is indicated to determine the etiology of the patient's chronic spinal pain and guide appropriate treatment interventions."
