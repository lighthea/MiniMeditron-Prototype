  "Vestibular Schwannomas_1": "Patient A, a 45-year-old male with no history of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), presented with a concerning constellation of symptoms. He reported a gradual, progressive loss of serviceable hearing in his left ear, which has persisted for the last 18 months. His preoperative hearing tests revealed a significant decrease in auditory function. Additionally, he experienced episodes of vertigo and an intermittent loss of balance, particularly when making sudden head movements. The patient also reported sharp, electric shock-like facial pains consistent with trigeminal neuralgia, further complicating his clinical presentation. Given these symptoms, the diagnostic process may be influenced by the size of the vestibular schwannoma, the preoperative hearing quality, and the potential need for microsurgical resection following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).",
  "Vestibular Schwannomas_2": "Patient B, a 37-year-old female with a family history of NF2, sought medical evaluation for a complex set of symptoms. She reported a gradual, pronounced loss of hearing in her right ear, which had been present for over two years. Preoperative testing confirmed a significant decline in her hearing function. The patient also described persistent episodes of imbalance and unsteadiness, often leading to near-falls. Furthermore, she experienced sharp, shooting facial pains characteristic of trigeminal neuralgia. The presence of NF2 in her family history adds a crucial diagnostic consideration to her case.",
  "Vestibular Schwannomas_3": "Patient C, a 50-year-old male, presented with a concerning array of symptoms. He reported a progressive and substantial loss of serviceable hearing in his right ear over the past year. Audiometric evaluation revealed a notable preoperative hearing loss. The patient also complained of recurrent episodes of vertigo and imbalance, particularly when turning his head or changing positions. Additionally, he experienced sharp, shooting facial pains consistent with trigeminal neuralgia. The diagnostic process for this patient may be influenced by the size of the vestibular schwannoma, the preoperative hearing quality, and the presence or absence of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)."
