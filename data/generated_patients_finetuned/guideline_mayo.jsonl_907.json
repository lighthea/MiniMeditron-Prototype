  "Seborrheic keratosis_1": "Patient A, a 60-year-old Caucasian male, presents with multiple skin lesions consistent with seborrheic keratosis. These lesions appear as round or oval-shaped waxy bumps, ranging in size from very small to over 1 inch across, and are observed on his chest, shoulders, and back. The patient reports occasional itchiness associated with these growths. His medical history is notable for a family history of similar skin lesions. Given the patient's age and the presence of characteristic waxy, rough bumps, seborrheic keratosis is a leading differential diagnosis.",
  "Seborrheic keratosis_2": "Patient B, a 45-year-old Black female, seeks medical attention for the presence of small, clustered growths on her face, commonly referred to as flesh moles or dermatosis papulosa nigra. These flat, scaly lesions, which are common on Black or brown skin, vary in color from light tan to brown or black. The patient reports a mild, intermittent itchiness associated with these skin growths. Notably, there is a family history of similar dermatological findings. Based on the clinical presentation, seborrheic keratosis is a prominent consideration, given the patient's age, ethnicity, and the observed characteristic growth patterns.",
  "Seborrheic keratosis_3": "Patient C, a 55-year-old male, has a single, slightly raised bump with a scaly surface on his face. The lesion measures approximately 0.5 inches in diameter and is light tan in color. The patient reports infrequent itchiness associated with this skin growth. He has no significant medical history or family history of similar conditions. Given the patient's age, the clinical appearance of the lesion, and the presence of itchiness, seborrheic keratosis is a primary diagnostic consideration. Further evaluation is warranted to confirm the diagnosis and explore potential treatment options."
