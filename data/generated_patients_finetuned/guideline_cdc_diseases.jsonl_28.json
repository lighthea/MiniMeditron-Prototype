  "Mumps_1": " 1. A 25-year-old male patient presented with a 5-day history of low-grade fever (100.8\u00b0F), a persistent and moderately severe headache localized behind the ears, along with marked muscle aches and a profound sense of tiredness. He reported a complete loss of appetite, which has contributed to a noticeable weight loss over the past week. On examination, the patient exhibited swollen and markedly tender glands under the left ear, consistent with parotitis. Notably, the patient had close contact with a family member diagnosed with mumps. These findings, along with the contextual information, strongly indicate a high index of suspicion for mumps in this case.",
  "Mumps_2": "2. A 21-year-old female patient, with no significant medical history, presented with a 3-day history of fever (101.5\u00b0F) and a persistent, severe headache. She described generalized muscle aches and pronounced tiredness, which has led to a notable decrease in her daily activities. The patient also reported a complete loss of appetite. On examination, bilateral swelling and tenderness of the glands under her ears and jaw were observed, confirming the presence of parotitis. The patient is a college student and had recent close-contact exposure to a peer who developed mumps. These clinical and contextual details strongly support the likelihood of mumps in this patient.",
  "Mumps_3": "3. An 18-year-old male patient, with a history of seasonal allergies, presented with a 4-day history of recurrent, low-grade fever (100.2\u00b0F), accompanied by a persistent headache localized around the ears and jaw. The patient reported moderate muscle aches and a sense of profound tiredness. He had experienced a loss of appetite, leading to a noticeable weight loss over the past week. On examination, there was evident swelling and tenderness of the glands under both ears, indicative of parotitis. The patient is an active participant in a close-contact sports team and had been in frequent contact with teammates, some of whom were later diagnosed with mumps. These clinical and contextual factors strongly suggest the presence of mumps in this case."
