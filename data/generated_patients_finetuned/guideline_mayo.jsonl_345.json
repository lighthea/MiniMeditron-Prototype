  "Egg Allergy_1": "  Description 1:\nA 9-year-old patient, with a family history of allergies, presented with a complex set of symptoms. The child has been experiencing recurrent episodes of skin inflammation and hives, often accompanied by nasal congestion, runny nose, and sneezing. Additionally, the patient has reported digestive symptoms, including cramps, nausea, and occasional vomiting, after the consumption of certain foods. The episodes are frequently followed by asthma-like signs, such as coughing, wheezing, and chest tightness, with a notable constriction of airways. The child has a history of atopic dermatitis. The overall clinical picture is further complicated by abdominal pain and cramping, along with a rapid pulse during symptomatic episodes. Given the family history and the age of the patient, the diagnostic process should take into account the potential influence of atopic dermatitis, food intolerance, and genetic factors.",
