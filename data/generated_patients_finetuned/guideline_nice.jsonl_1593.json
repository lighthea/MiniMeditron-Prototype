  "Aortic valve stenosis_2": "A 68-year-old male patient, with a history of rheumatic fever in his adolescence, presented with a concerning clinical picture. He reported recurrent episodes of exertional angina, characterized by chest pain reaching 7/10 on the pain scale, which has been progressively worsening over the past six months. Furthermore, he experienced notable shortness of breath during physical activity, often leading to fainting spells. The patient described intermittent palpitations, which he attributed to his overall discomfort. Physical examination revealed a systolic murmur in the aortic area. Given the patient's age, history of rheumatic fever, and the constellation of symptoms, there is a strong clinical suspicion of aortic valve stenosis. Diagnostic evaluation is paramount to determine the severity of the valve obstruction and guide further management.",
  "Aortic valve stenosis_4": "A 55-year-old female patient, without a history of rheumatic fever, presented with a complex symptomatology. She reported recurrent episodes of angina, with chest pain peaking at 6/10 in intensity, often triggered by exertion. The anginal episodes have been ongoing for the past year and have significantly impacted her quality of life. Additionally, the patient described a persistent sensation of palpitations, which she found distressing. Despite her relatively young age, she had been experiencing shortness of breath during strenuous activities, along with occasional fainting spells. These symptoms raised concerns, prompting a thorough cardiovascular assessment. Given the patient's age and the presence of angina, palpitations, and exertional dyspnea, aortic valve stenosis is among the primary diagnostic considerations.",
  "Aortic valve stenosis_6": "A 78-year-old male patient, with a documented history of age-related aortic valve sclerosis, presented with a complex clinical presentation. He reported recurrent episodes of exertional angina, with chest pain peaking at 8/10 in intensity, substantially limiting his physical activities. The anginal symptoms had been persistent for the past two years and showed a progressive trend. The patient also experienced pronounced shortness of breath during exertion, often resulting in near-syncopal episodes. He described intermittent palpitations, which he found alarming. The physical examination revealed a systolic murmur over the aortic area. Given the patient's advanced age, documented valve sclerosis, and the constellation of symptoms, aortic valve stenosis is the leading diagnostic consideration. Further evaluation is crucial to assess the severity of the stenosis and plan an appropriate management strategy."
