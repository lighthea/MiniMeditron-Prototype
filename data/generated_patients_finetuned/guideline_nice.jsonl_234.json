  "Subglottic or tracheal stenosis_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 45-year-old female, non-smoker, with a history of prolonged intubation (duration of 10 days) following a traumatic accident, presented with a persistent hoarseness, which she rated at 4/10 in terms of discomfort. She also reported intermittent episodes of stridor, especially during physical exertion, causing exercise intolerance with a pain score of 5/10. The patient's respiratory distress was evident during the physical examination. Given her history of traumatic intubation, the presence of hoarseness, stridor, exercise intolerance, and respiratory distress, a comprehensive evaluation is warranted to determine the etiology of her symptoms.",
  "Subglottic or tracheal stenosis_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 30-year-old male, previously healthy, reported a 6-month history of worsening hoarseness, rated at 3/10 in terms of discomfort, without a clear inciting event. He experienced occasional stridor and had developed exercise intolerance, which he rated at 4/10 in terms of pain. The patient denied any history of endotracheal intubation or trauma to the neck. Physical examination revealed intermittent stridor and hoarseness. These symptoms, along with exercise intolerance, raise concerns about his respiratory health and warrant further evaluation to discern the underlying cause.",
  "Subglottic or tracheal stenosis_3": "    Patient Description 3:\n    A 4-month-old infant, born full-term without any perinatal complications, was brought in by the parents due to a persistent hoarse cry and noisy breathing, characterized by stridor, which was noted to worsen during feeding and rated at 5/10 in terms of distress. The infant also exhibited respiratory distress, especially during feeding times, with a pain score of 6/10. There is no history of endotracheal intubation. Physical examination confirmed the presence of hoarseness, stridor, and respiratory distress. Given the congenital context and the observed symptoms, a prompt and thorough diagnostic assessment is crucial to determine the nature of the infant's airway condition and guide appropriate management."
