  "HIV Infection_1": "    Case 1: Mr. A, a 32-year-old male with a history of high-risk behavior, presented with a constellation of symptoms indicative of acute HIV infection. He reported a flu-like illness, including persistent fever (101\u00b0F), malaise, and a generalized maculopapular rash. Additionally, he described severe and prolonged night sweats, unintentional weight loss (10% of body weight in the last 3 months), and oral thrush. Notably, he has a history of substance use disorder. Given his symptoms and lifestyle, the presence of concurrent opportunistic infections, such as tuberculosis or cryptococcal meningitis, could complicate the diagnostic process.",
  "HIV Infection_2": "    Case 2: Ms. B, a 28-year-old female, sought medical attention after experiencing a flu-like illness accompanied by multiple concerning symptoms. She reported a persistent low-grade fever, oral thrush, and generalized lymphadenopathy. In addition, she complained of severe headache, photophobia, and neck stiffness, raising the possibility of tuberculous or cryptococcal meningitis. Notably, she has a history of recurrent respiratory infections. The diagnostic process for acute HIV infection in this patient is influenced by the potential concurrent presence of tuberculosis and tuberculous meningitis, which are important factors to consider.",
  "HIV Infection_3": "    Case 3: Mr. C, a 40-year-old male, with a known history of high-risk behavior and previous sexually transmitted infections, presented with symptoms suggestive of acute HIV infection. He described a persistent fever accompanied by a severe, non-productive cough and unintentional weight loss. Furthermore, he reported night sweats and fatigue, along with the recent onset of dyspnea. Given his medical history and lifestyle, the diagnostic evaluation is complicated by the potential concurrent presence of tuberculosis, which may mimic or exacerbate the respiratory symptoms associated with HIV infection. This necessitates a comprehensive assessment to differentiate the underlying conditions."
