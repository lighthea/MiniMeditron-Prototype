  "Pulmonary Atresia_1": "1. The patient, a 3-month-old infant, was brought in by her parents with concerning symptoms. The infant has been experiencing persistent cyanosis, with a bluish discoloration of the skin especially noticeable during episodes of crying or feeding. The parents reported that the baby frequently displays fast breathing and appears to tire easily during feeding. These symptoms have led to a notable lack of weight gain. Notably, there is a family history of congenital heart defects, with the patient's mother also being diagnosed with a heart condition. The presence of cyanosis, respiratory distress, feeding difficulties, and a positive family history necessitates a comprehensive cardiac evaluation to determine the underlying etiology of the infant's condition.",
  "Pulmonary Atresia_2": "2. A 5-year-old child was referred to our cardiology clinic due to recurrent episodes of cyanosis and shortness of breath during physical activities. The child's parents reported that even minor exertion, such as playing, leads to fast breathing and visible cyanosis. Additionally, the child exhibits signs of fatigue and reduced tolerance for physical activities, which is impacting their daily life. Notably, there is no family history of congenital heart defects. However, the mother had a history of obesity before and during pregnancy. Given the child's symptoms, including cyanosis, exercise intolerance, and shortness of breath, along with the maternal obesity, a thorough cardiac assessment is imperative to establish a precise diagnosis and guide appropriate management.",
  "Pulmonary Atresia_3": "3. A 21-year-old female presented with a history of exertional dyspnea, generalized fatigue, and cyanosis, which becomes more pronounced during periods of increased physical activity. The patient reported a lifelong struggle with breathlessness during exercise, often necessitating frequent breaks. Physical examination revealed a persistent bluish discoloration of the skin, particularly noticeable on the lips and extremities. There is no significant family history of heart disease; however, the patient's mother had a history of poorly controlled diabetes before and during pregnancy. The presence of cyanosis, exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and the maternal medical history warrants a comprehensive cardiac assessment to elucidate the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and formulate an optimal management plan."
