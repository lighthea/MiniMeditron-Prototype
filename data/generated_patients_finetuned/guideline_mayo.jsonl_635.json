  "Mesenteric lymphadenitis_1": "    Patient A, a 14-year-old teenager, presented with a persistent, localized abdominal pain rated at 6/10 in intensity, primarily focused on the lower right side but occasionally radiating diffusely. Physical examination revealed general tenderness in the abdominal region, along with an enlarged mesenteric lymph node. The patient has been experiencing episodes of fever and has reported intermittent diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Given the age of the patient, the symptoms align with mesenteric lymphadenitis, and further diagnostic evaluation is warranted to confirm the underlying cause.",

Physical examination revealed generalized tenderness in the abdominal region, accompanied by an enlarged mesenteric lymph node. The patient has been experiencing episodes of fever, as well as intermittent diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Further assessment is necessary to elucidate the etiology of these symptoms and confirm the diagnosis.",
  "Mesenteric lymphadenitis_3": "    Patient C, a 10-year-old child, presented with a persistent abdominal pain rated at 7/10 in intensity, primarily centered on the lower right side but occasionally more widespread.
