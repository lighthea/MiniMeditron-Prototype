  "moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease in adults_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 44-year-old male patient with a history of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease presented with persistent abdominal pain and cramping, rated at 6/10 in intensity, along with recurrent episodes of diarrhoea. The diarrhoea, occurring 4-6 times a day, is accompanied by the passage of blood and mucus in stools. The patient reported a noticeable fatigue, which has been impacting his daily activities. Despite prior biological treatment, there has been a suboptimal response, and the patient has developed a tolerance to the previous therapy. No contraindications to TNF-alpha inhibitors were identified. Given the history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, as well as the observed weight loss, further evaluation and management are warranted for this complex case.",
