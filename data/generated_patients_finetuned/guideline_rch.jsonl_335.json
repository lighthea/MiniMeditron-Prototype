  "Serotonin Toxicity_1": "Doctor's Description 1:\nA 28-year-old male patient with a history of anxiety disorder presented to the emergency department with a constellation of symptoms consistent with serotonin toxicity. The patient reported ingesting an increased dose of his prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) in an attempt to self-manage his anxiety. On examination, he exhibited CNS dysfunction, including restlessness, confusion, and tremors, along with autonomic dysfunction manifested by diaphoresis, tachycardia, and hypertension. The patient's neuromuscular function showed clonus, hypertonia, and rigidity. The clinical presentation, along with the patient's history of SSRI ingestion, strongly indicates serotonin toxicity.",
  "Serotonin Toxicity_2": "Doctor's Description 2:\nA 35-year-old female with a known history of depression and recent initiation of a new SSRI medication presented with a complex clinical picture suggestive of serotonin toxicity. The patient reported concomitant use of an over-the-counter herbal supplement for mood enhancement. She exhibited altered mental status, myoclonus, and hyperreflexia, indicating CNS dysfunction. Autonomic dysfunction was evident with tachycardia, diaphoresis, and hyperthermia. Neuromuscular dysfunction, including clonus and hypertonia, was also observed. The patient's recent SSRI initiation, combined with herbal supplement use, raises a strong suspicion of serotonin toxicity.",
  "Serotonin Toxicity_3": "Doctor's Description 3:\nIn the emergency department, a 40-year-old male patient, who had a history of migraines, presented with a complex clinical presentation suggestive of serotonin toxicity. The patient acknowledged the use of a combination of triptans and an SSRI for the management of his migraines and concomitant depression. He displayed CNS dysfunction, including agitation, myoclonus, and tremors, as well as autonomic dysfunction characterized by diaphoresis, hypertension, and tachycardia. Additionally, the patient exhibited neuromuscular dysfunction, with clonus, hypertonia, and rigidity. The combination of serotonergic agents used by the patient further supports the diagnosis of serotonin toxicity."
