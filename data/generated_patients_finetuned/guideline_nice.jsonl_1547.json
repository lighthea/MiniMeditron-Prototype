  "Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis affecting the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint at the base of the big toe_1": "Patient A, a 58-year-old avid hiker, presents with a persistent, progressively worsening condition involving the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint at the base of the big toe. The most notable symptom is the pronounced stiffness in the joint (hallux rigidus), which significantly impedes their range of motion and is rated at 7/10 on the pain scale. Additionally, there is a visible deformation of the joint (hallux valgus). The patient's lifestyle, which heavily revolves around outdoor activities, is profoundly impacted as they experience sharp pain (rated 6/10) during walking, especially when navigating uneven terrains. These symptoms have persisted for over a year, and conservative treatments, such as orthotic inserts and physical therapy, have provided little relief. The diagnostic process is notably influenced by the patient's strong desire to regain their mobility and continue pursuing their active lifestyle.",
  "Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis affecting the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint at the base of the big toe_2": "Patient B, a 42-year-old office worker, seeks medical evaluation for a chronic issue affecting the MTP joint at the base of their big toe. The main manifestation is a persistent stiffness in the joint (hallux rigidus), which has been gradually worsening over the past two years, making it challenging for the patient to bend the toe during activities such as walking or climbing stairs. They report a constant, dull pain (rated at 5/10) in the affected joint, further impacting their daily activities. Notably, the patient has observed a mild deformation of the joint (hallux valgus). Given their occupation that involves prolonged periods of standing and walking, the discomfort and restricted mobility have become increasingly bothersome. Previous attempts at self-managing the condition with over-the-counter pain medications have yielded inadequate relief. The diagnostic process is influenced by the patient's need to address these symptoms to maintain productivity at work.",
  "Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis affecting the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint at the base of the big toe_3": "Patient C, a 65-year-old retiree, presents with a persistent issue concerning the MTP joint at the base of their big toe. They describe a long-standing stiffness in the joint (hallux rigidus), which has gradually worsened over the past three years, severely limiting their ability to engage in recreational activities such as walking and gardening. The stiffness is accompanied by a noticeable deformation of the joint (hallux valgus). The patient experiences aching pain in the affected area, with the intensity consistently rated at 6/10, further impacting their enjoyment of retirement pursuits. These symptoms have prompted the patient to seek medical attention after finding little relief from non-prescription pain relief measures. The diagnostic process is influenced by the patient's strong desire to regain mobility and alleviate the discomfort that hinders their lifestyle."
