  "Impacted wisdom teeth_1": "    Description 1:\n    \n    A 25-year-old patient, with a history of occasional dental discomfort, presented with moderate to severe inflammation of the gum tissue in the region of their lower molars. The inflammation is persistent and has been accompanied by intermittent episodes of pain, rated at 6-8 on a visual analog scale. Despite maintaining good oral hygiene, the patient has a higher risk of tooth decay in the affected area. Clinical examination reveals that the impacted wisdom teeth lack sufficient space for eruption, and they are partially covered by the gum tissue. This anatomical limitation, along with the presence of other teeth in the path of eruption, adds complexity to the diagnostic process.",
  "Impacted wisdom teeth_2": "    Description 2:\n    \n    A 30-year-old patient, known for meticulous oral care, visited our clinic with a troubling dental issue. They have been experiencing recurrent gum disease in the vicinity of their upper molars, despite dedicated oral hygiene practices. The patient reports discomfort and tenderness in the affected gum area, with pain levels reaching 5-7 on the pain scale. Notably, the gum inflammation appears to be associated with the presence of impacted wisdom teeth, which are partially covered by the gum tissue. Furthermore, the proximity of these impacted teeth to the adjacent molars has led to a higher risk of tooth decay in the region. The diagnostic process is influenced by the lack of space for proper eruption and the obstructive nature of other teeth in the path.",
  "Impacted wisdom teeth_4": "    A 28-year-old patient with a history of dental issues presented with a concerning pattern of symptoms. They have been experiencing chronic gum inflammation around the lower molars, often accompanied by discomfort and tenderness, with pain rated at 4-6 on the pain scale. Despite efforts to prevent gum disease, the patient continues to face challenges in this area. Clinical examination revealed the presence of impacted wisdom teeth, which are partially covered by the inflamed gum tissue. This inflammation has also increased the risk of tooth decay in the affected area. The diagnostic process is compounded by the lack of space for proper wisdom tooth eruption and the obstructive influence of adjacent teeth. "
