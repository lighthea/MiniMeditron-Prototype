  "Spinal Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM)_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 25-year-old male patient with no significant medical history presented with a complex set of symptoms. The patient reported a sudden, severe back pain localized in the lower back region, which he described as debilitating (8/10 on the pain scale). This pain is accompanied by numbness, tingling, and sudden sharp pain in both legs, particularly when walking or climbing stairs. The patient also experienced weakness on both sides of his body, further complicating his mobility. Additionally, he reported a persistent headache, stiff neck, and sensitivity to light. Notably, the lack of sensation in his legs has been observed. Given the patient's age, the presence of these symptoms poses a diagnostic challenge, as they overlap with various other spinal conditions.",
  "Spinal Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM)_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 30-year-old female patient with a history of intermittent back pain presented with a concerning array of symptoms. She reported a sudden, severe back pain that she rated as 7/10 in intensity, localized in the thoracic region. The pain is associated with numbness, tingling, and sudden sharp pain in her legs, particularly during physical activities. The patient described weakness on one side of her body, affecting her arm and leg on the same side. Furthermore, she experienced difficulties in urination and bowel movements. The presence of these neurological and musculoskeletal symptoms, coupled with the patient's age and her history of episodic back pain, presents a diagnostic challenge, as these manifestations overlap with several spinal conditions.",
  "Spinal Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM)_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 16-year-old adolescent male patient, without any significant medical history, presented with a complex set of symptoms. He reported sudden, severe back pain in the lumbar region, with a pain intensity rating of 8/10. This pain is accompanied by numbness, tingling, and sudden sharp pain in his legs, especially during physical activities, such as walking or climbing stairs. The patient also described a lack of feeling in his legs and difficulty urinating. Additionally, he reported recurrent headaches, a stiff neck, and sensitivity to light. The presence of these symptoms in a young patient presents a diagnostic challenge, as they overlap with various other spinal conditions, and almost 20% of individuals diagnosed with spinal AVM are under the age of 16."
