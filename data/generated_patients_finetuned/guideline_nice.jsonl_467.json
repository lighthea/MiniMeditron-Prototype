  "Congenital aniridia_1": "  Patient A, a 25-year-old female, presents with a spectrum of ophthalmic symptoms. She reports a long-standing history of photophobia, rating her light sensitivity as 8/10 in intensity, often accompanied by significant glare, especially in bright environments. Despite wearing tinted glasses, she experiences progressive vision loss, with a current visual acuity of 20/200 in both eyes. Additionally, she describes the presence of nystagmus. Ophthalmic examination reveals a substantial absence of iris tissue, contributing to her photophobia and glare issues. Furthermore, the patient exhibits corneal opacification, along with early signs of glaucoma and cataract formation. The varied extent of iris tissue absence and the degree of vision impairment, in conjunction with the coexistence of other ocular pathologies, present diagnostic challenges in this case.",
  "Congenital aniridia_2": "  The notable variation in the presentation of this patient's symptoms, compounded by her young age, underscores the complexity of diagnosing and managing congenital aniridia. Detailed ophthalmic assessment and diagnostic testing will be crucial in formulating an individualized treatment plan to address her multi-faceted ocular manifestations.",
  "Congenital aniridia_3": "  A comprehensive evaluation considering the differential impact of missing iris tissue, visual impairment severity, and the concurrent presence of various eye conditions will guide the diagnostic approach, optimize therapeutic interventions, and enhance the long-term visual prognosis for the patient."
