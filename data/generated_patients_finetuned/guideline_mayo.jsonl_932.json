  "Sleep terrors_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 25-year-old female patient presented with a concerning history of sleep-related events. She experiences recurrent episodes of screaming and shouting during sleep, often accompanied by sitting up in bed with a frightened appearance. The patient's partner noted that she displays wide-eyed staring, heavy sweating, and has a racing pulse during these episodes. Despite their efforts, she is challenging to awaken and appears confused if roused from sleep during these events. The patient has no or little memory of the episodes the next morning. Furthermore, she occasionally exhibits aggressive behavior if restrained during these episodes. The presence of these symptoms is notable, especially given the patient's family history of sleep terrors and her gender. The episodes have been exacerbated during periods of sleep deprivation and in association with increased stress levels.",
  "Sleep terrors_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 32-year-old male patient presented with a puzzling sleep-related issue. He described episodes during which he would scream and thrash about while asleep, often accompanied by a flushed face, heavy breathing, and dilated pupils. These events are frequently associated with his travel or sleep interruptions, and during episodes of fever. The patient's sleep terrors are particularly distressing, as he is hard to awaken and displays inconsolability during and after the episodes. He has a history of restless legs syndrome, which seems to exacerbate the frequency and intensity of these episodes. The patient's account, along with his medical history and the contextual factors, underscores the impact of sleep disruptions, travel, and fever on his condition.",
