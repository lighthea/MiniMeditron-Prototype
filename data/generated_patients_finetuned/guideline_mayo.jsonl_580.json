  "Lactose intolerance_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 28-year-old female patient, of Asian ethnicity, presented with recurrent episodes of diarrhea, rating her pain at 6/10, accompanied by nausea, stomach cramps (pain level 5/10), and bloating. She reported a history of similar but milder symptoms that began in her teenage years, often associated with the consumption of dairy products. Her symptoms have persisted despite dietary modifications, including reduced dairy intake. There is no significant medical history or cancer treatment. Given her ethnic background and the chronic nature of her gastrointestinal symptoms, lactose intolerance is a leading consideration.",
  "Lactose intolerance_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 32-year-old male patient, with no specific ethnic predisposition, reported frequent episodes of diarrhea and vomiting, often accompanied by severe stomach cramps (pain level 8/10), bloating, and excessive gas. The symptoms have been ongoing for several years and have significantly impacted his quality of life. The patient has a history of premature birth. Despite multiple dietary adjustments and over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medications, the gastrointestinal manifestations persist. Given the chronic nature of his symptoms, in the context of premature birth, lactose intolerance is a primary diagnostic consideration.",
  "Lactose intolerance_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 40-year-old male patient, of Caucasian ethnicity, presented with a history of recurring diarrhea, nausea, vomiting episodes, and abdominal bloating. He described the stomach cramps as moderate in intensity (pain level 4/10). The symptoms have been present for over a decade and are often linked to the consumption of dairy products. The patient has no significant medical history, but his sibling has a known lactose intolerance. Despite attempts to self-manage his condition through dietary restrictions, the gastrointestinal issues persist. Given the patient's ethnicity, family history, and chronic nature of the symptoms, lactose intolerance is a prominent diagnostic consideration."
