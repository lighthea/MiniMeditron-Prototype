  "Hodgkin lymphoma_6": "A 40-year-old male, known to have a history of past Epstein-Barr infection, presented with a one-month history of painless swelling of lymph nodes in his neck, armpits, and groin. The patient reported persistent fatigue (rated 5/10 in severity), along with intermittent low-grade fevers and night sweats.
