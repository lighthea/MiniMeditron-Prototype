  "Unequal limb lengths caused by trauma or infection or, more rarely, hypoplasia or dysplasia (congenital conditions such as achondroplasia, Ollier\"s disease, and brachial plexus palsy). The condition can be unilateral or bilateral._1": "Description 1: \nA 32-year-old male patient presented with a noticeable discrepancy in limb lengths, with the right lower limb appearing shorter than the left. The condition has led to a pronounced disability, especially during weight-bearing activities, causing the patient significant discomfort and limited functional ability. Notably, the patient has a history of trauma to the right leg following a motor vehicle accident several years ago, which is likely linked to the observed unequal limb lengths. Diagnostic assessment is crucial to determine the extent of the underlying bone pathology and its contribution to the limb length inequality.",
  "Unequal limb lengths caused by trauma or infection or, more rarely, hypoplasia or dysplasia (congenital conditions such as achondroplasia, Ollier\"s disease, and brachial plexus palsy). The condition can be unilateral or bilateral._2": "Description 2:\nA 26-year-old female patient was evaluated for a persistent discrepancy in limb lengths, which has been a source of disability and limited functional ability in her daily life. The condition, characterized by the left lower limb being shorter than the right, has been a long-standing concern for the patient. Notably, the patient's medical history includes a childhood diagnosis of Ollier's disease. This congenital condition may play a role in the observed limb length inequality. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is essential to assess the underlying bone pathology and its impact on the patient's condition.",
  "Unequal limb lengths caused by trauma or infection or, more rarely, hypoplasia or dysplasia (congenital conditions such as achondroplasia, Ollier\"s disease, and brachial plexus palsy). The condition can be unilateral or bilateral._3": "Description 3: \nIn the clinical setting, a 40-year-old male patient presented with a bilateral inequality in limb lengths, leading to a notable disability and limited functional ability during weight-bearing activities. The patient's history is significant for a rare congenital condition known as achondroplasia. This condition, characterized by abnormal bone growth, is a potential cause of the observed limb length inequality. Given the underlying congenital nature of achondroplasia, diagnostic assessment is crucial to better understand its contribution to the patient's presentation and to formulate an appropriate management plan."
