  "Septic arthritis_1": "  Patient A, a 45-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use, presented with a fever of 102\u00b0F and a persistent, intense pain localized in his left knee, which he described as 8/10 on the pain scale. The pain has severely limited the joint's use, causing him difficulty in walking and performing daily activities. The symptoms have been ongoing for five days. Upon further inquiry, the patient denied any recent trauma or injury to the affected joint. Given the context of his immunocompromised state, there is a heightened concern for septic arthritis, and urgent diagnostic assessment is warranted.",
  "Septic arthritis_2": "Patient B is a 65-year-old female who reported to the clinic with a fever and excruciating pain (9/10 on the pain scale) in her right shoulder joint. She described a sudden onset of symptoms, which have persisted for three days. The pain has severely limited the range of motion in her shoulder, hampering her ability to dress herself and perform routine tasks. Notably, she has no history of trauma or injury to the affected joint. In light of her presentation and the absence of an apparent inciting event, septic arthritis is a significant diagnostic consideration, necessitating prompt evaluation and intervention.",
  "Septic arthritis_3": "  A 4-month-old infant, Patient C, was brought in by parents who noted irritability, along with a fever, in their child. The infant has been irritable for two days, and the parents observed a decreased movement and reluctance to bear weight on the left leg. Although the infant's verbalization is limited, the parents indicated distress during diaper changes and bathing, suggesting localized discomfort. There is no history of trauma or injury. Given the infant's age, irritability, and the presence of fever, along with the observed functional limitations, septic arthritis is a critical diagnostic consideration, necessitating expedited evaluation and management."
