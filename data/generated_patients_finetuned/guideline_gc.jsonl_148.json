  "Venous Thromboembolic Disease in Colorectal Surgery_1": "Patient A, a 62-year-old male, presents with a complex medical history including obesity, hypertension, and a prior deep vein thrombosis (DVT) episode. He recently underwent elective colorectal surgery. The patient is currently experiencing localized pain and swelling in his left leg, which he rates at 6/10 on the pain scale. Physical examination reveals increased warmth and erythema in the affected limb. Notably, the patient's postoperative mobility has been limited. Given his risk profile and the observed symptoms, a comprehensive assessment using a risk assessment model is crucial to evaluate the likelihood of venous thromboembolic disease in this clinical scenario.",
  "Venous Thromboembolic Disease in Colorectal Surgery_2": "Patient B, a 55-year-old female, is admitted for postoperative care following an extensive colorectal surgical procedure. She has a notable history of smoking and oral contraceptive use. The patient reports sudden onset of sharp chest pain, which she rates at 8/10 in intensity, exacerbated by deep inspiration. Additionally, she experiences shortness of breath at rest. On auscultation, there are clear signs of tachypnea. A risk assessment model is essential in this case to guide the diagnostic process and assess the probability of venous thromboembolic disease.",
  "Venous Thromboembolic Disease in Colorectal Surgery_3": "Following colorectal surgery, Patient C, a 68-year-old male, with a history of atrial fibrillation, presents with atypical chest discomfort, rated 5/10 in severity, along with dyspnea on exertion. The patient's postoperative course has been complicated by prolonged bed rest due to surgical site complications. Physical examination is significant for tachycardia. Given the patient's risk factors and the constellation of symptoms, a comprehensive assessment utilizing a risk assessment model is imperative to evaluate the presence of venous thromboembolic disease in this clinical context."
