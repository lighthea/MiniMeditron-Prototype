  "Child Maltreatment_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 2-year-old female patient with a history of special health care needs was brought in by her single mother, who has a low income and limited social support. The child presented with unexplained bruises on multiple body areas. The mother reported that these injuries occurred frequently, and she was unable to provide a consistent explanation for them. The patient's behavior appeared unusually withdrawn during the physical examination. Given the combination of the child's young age, female sex, special health care needs, and the presence of unexplained injuries, there is a high index of suspicion for possible child maltreatment.",
  "Child Maltreatment_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 3-year-old male patient, residing in a community with high rates of violence and unemployment, was brought in by his nonbiological parents with concerns about his recurrent injuries. The child's medical history is unremarkable, but the parents seem unable to provide a satisfactory explanation for the observed bruises and abrasions on the patient's body. During the examination, the child appeared irritable, and his behavior raised further concerns. The contextual factors of living in a high-violence community and having nonbiological parents, combined with the unexplained injuries, strongly suggest the need to assess the possibility of child maltreatment.",
  "Child Maltreatment_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 4-year-old male patient was brought in by his young, single mother, who reported concerns about her child's repeated injuries, which she could not account for consistently. The child's behavior was observed to be extremely fearful and withdrawn during the clinical evaluation. The family resides in an area with weak social networks, and the mother has a history of low educational attainment. These contextual factors, along with the unexplained injuries and the child's young age, raise a significant red flag for potential child maltreatment. Further evaluation and intervention are warranted in this case."
