  "Pericarditis_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 37-year-old male with a history of viral upper respiratory tract infection presented with a four-day history of progressively worsening chest pain. The pain is predominantly sharp and stabbing, localized behind the breastbone and on the left side of the chest, with a reported intensity of 7/10. The patient noted that the pain increases when coughing, lying down, or taking deep breaths. Additionally, he has been experiencing a persistent low-grade fever and a general feeling of weakness. On examination, the patient exhibited heart palpitations and reported occasional shortness of breath when lying down. There is no history of significant underlying medical conditions. The diagnostic approach will consider the type and duration of pericarditis symptoms in this case.",
  "Pericarditis_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 46-year-old female, known to have a history of autoimmune disease, presented with a two-week history of chest pain, which she described as dull, achy, and pressure-like, with an intensity of 5/10. The pain radiates to her left shoulder and neck. She has also been coughing intermittently and feeling fatigued. The patient reported a pounding or racing heartbeat (heart palpitations) and occasional leg swelling. Physical examination revealed no significant abnormalities in the abdomen. Given the patient's autoimmune history, a comprehensive diagnostic assessment, taking into account the type of pericarditis and the duration of symptoms, is crucial in this scenario.",
  "Pericarditis_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 29-year-old otherwise healthy male patient presented with a one-week history of chest pain. He reported a sharp and stabbing pain, localized behind the breastbone and on the left side of the chest, with an intensity rating of 8/10. The pain worsens when coughing and taking deep breaths, but improves when the patient sits up or leans forward. He denied any cough but mentioned a persistent general feeling of weakness. There was no significant medical history or recent illness. The patient also experienced a sensation of shortness of breath when lying down. A careful assessment, considering the type of pericarditis and the duration of symptoms, is crucial for an accurate diagnosis and management plan."
