  "COVID-19_1": "**Case 1:**\nA 38-year-old male patient with a history of mild asthma presented with a persistent dry cough, rated at 4/10 for discomfort, and gradually increasing shortness of breath, now at level 6/10, which is not alleviated by his quick-relief inhaler. He also reported a low-grade fever, averaging 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) for the past five days, along with a general feeling of fatigue. The patient's occupational role requires frequent interactions with the public. Given his age and the presence of respiratory symptoms, COVID-19 is a significant consideration despite the absence of confirmed exposure.",
  "COVID-19_2": "**Case 2:**\nA 64-year-old female patient, with a medical history notable for hypertension, came in reporting a sudden onset of fever, peaking at 101.3\u00b0F (38.5\u00b0C), and myalgias, which she described as severe, with a pain level of 8/10. She also complained of a persistent, dry cough, rated at 3/10, and an unusual sense of fatigue. The patient's occupation involves regular contact with individuals who could potentially be infected with COVID-19. Given her age, the presence of fever, myalgias, and occupational context, COVID-19 must be a primary consideration in her evaluation.",
  "COVID-19_3": "**Case 3:**\nA 45-year-old patient, otherwise healthy, presented with a high-grade fever fluctuating between 102.2\u00b0F (39\u00b0C) and 103.1\u00b0F (39.5\u00b0C) over the past week, accompanied by notable fatigue and malaise. The patient described her fatigue as overwhelming, interfering with daily activities, and rated it at 7/10. She also reported a dry cough, which she rated at 5/10 in terms of discomfort. Her occupation involves frequent travel and exposure to diverse populations. Given her age, the presence of a high-grade fever, and the associated fatigue, COVID-19 is a significant concern in the diagnostic approach."
