  "Dry mouth or xerostomia_1": "Doctor's Description 1:\nA 58-year-old male patient, with a history of hypertension and long-term medication use, presented with a persistent complaint of dryness and stickiness in the mouth, accompanied by thick, stringy saliva. The patient reported a sensation of bad breath and noted difficulties in chewing and swallowing. He also experienced a dry, sore throat and hoarseness. Despite using over-the-counter saliva substitutes, the symptoms have persisted, affecting his quality of life and leading to some degree of social embarrassment. The patient has a history of tobacco use, which he ceased five years ago. These symptoms have been ongoing for the past six months, and their impact on the patient's daily activities is notable. A comprehensive assessment is warranted to identify the underlying etiology and formulate an effective management plan.",
  "Dry mouth or xerostomia_2": "Doctor's Description 2:\nA 45-year-old female patient, with no significant medical history, presented with a constellation of symptoms indicative of xerostomia. The patient reported a persistent sensation of dryness and stickiness in her mouth, which was accompanied by a changed sense of taste. She also noted difficulties in speaking, as well as a dry, grooved tongue. The symptoms have been present for the last three months and have led to problems wearing her dental prostheses. Despite efforts to improve oral hydration and frequent water intake, the patient's condition has not shown significant improvement. Her lifestyle is notable for social alcohol consumption on weekends. A thorough evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying cause of her symptoms and initiate an appropriate treatment plan.",
  "Dry mouth or xerostomia_3": "Doctor's Description 3:\nA 67-year-old male patient, with a history of head and neck cancer treated with radiation therapy five years ago, presented with chronic complaints suggestive of xerostomia. The patient described a persistent dry mouth, thick and stringy saliva, and difficulty in swallowing. He reported a chronic dry or sore throat, as well as a feeling of hoarseness. The changed sense of taste and problems wearing dentures further compounded his oral discomfort. Despite the use of saliva stimulants, the patient's symptoms have persisted and significantly impacted his ability to eat and speak comfortably. His medical history is also significant for diabetes, which is well-controlled. Given the history of cancer therapy and associated radiation, the evaluation will focus on managing the long-term effects of treatment and improving the patient's quality of life."
