  "Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes_1": "    Description 1:\n    A 45-year-old male patient, with a history of hypertension, presented with chest discomfort characterized by a pressure sensation rated 5/10 on the pain scale. The pain has persisted for the last 24 hours and is occasionally radiating to the left arm. Notably, the patient's HEART score is 2. Serial high-sensitivity troponin testing has been negative. The initial ECG result is nonischemic. The patient is categorized as a low-risk ACS case, but given the persistent chest discomfort and the associated risk factors, further evaluation is warranted.",
  "Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes_2": "    Description 2:\n    A 55-year-old female patient, without significant past medical history, reported episodes of atypical chest pain with a severity rating of 4/10 in the last 48 hours. The pain is intermittent and does not radiate. Her HEART score is 1, and both serial high-sensitivity troponin testing and ECG results have been negative. Despite being classified as a low-risk ACS patient, the ongoing nature of her chest pain necessitates a comprehensive assessment to rule out any underlying cardiac pathology.",
  "Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes_3": "    Description 3:\n    An 60-year-old male patient, with a history of diabetes, presented with recurrent chest discomfort rated at 6/10 in intensity over the past 12 hours. The pain is described as pressure-like and occasionally radiates to the jaw. The patient's initial ECG is nonischemic, and serial high-sensitivity troponin testing has yielded negative results. However, his HEART score is 3, indicating an intermediate risk. Given the persistence and intensity of the chest pain, along with the presence of diabetes, a more in-depth evaluation is necessary to determine the etiology of his symptoms."
