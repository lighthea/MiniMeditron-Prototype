  "Complex orofacial reconstruction_1": "Case Description 1:\nA 42-year-old male patient, with no significant medical history, presents with severe orofacial trauma following a motor vehicle accident. The trauma has resulted in complex facial injuries, including multiple facial bone fractures, avulsed teeth, and soft tissue lacerations. The patient reports intense orofacial pain, with a score of 8/10 on the pain scale, and considerable difficulty in chewing and speaking. Physical examination reveals asymmetry of the facial structures and a limited range of motion in the temporomandibular joint. Diagnostic and treatment planning for orofacial reconstruction in this patient is crucial, given the severity of the trauma and the need for comprehensive restoration of both function and aesthetics.",
  "Complex orofacial reconstruction_2": "Case Description 2:\nA 55-year-old female patient, with a history of orofacial tumours, is referred for specialized care. The patient has undergone surgical removal of orofacial tumours in the past, resulting in extensive tissue loss and facial asymmetry. She presents with a complex orofacial reconstruction challenge, characterized by the need for restoring facial contour and addressing functional deficits. The patient experiences chronic orofacial pain, rated at 6/10 in intensity, and reports difficulty with mastication and articulation. Physical examination reveals scar tissue, soft tissue defects, and decreased oral aperture. Patient selection is of fundamental importance in determining the most suitable reconstructive approach, taking into account the prior tumor resection and the unique anatomical changes in the orofacial region.",
  "Complex orofacial reconstruction_3": "Case Description 3:\nAn 18-year-old male patient, born with congenital facial abnormalities, seeks evaluation for complex orofacial reconstruction. The patient's medical history indicates craniofacial anomalies, including cleft lip and palate, which have been previously addressed with surgical interventions during childhood. However, residual orofacial deformities and functional impairments persist into adulthood. The patient reports a persistent orofacial pain score of 5/10 and challenges related to speech articulation and dental occlusion. Physical examination reveals craniofacial asymmetry, residual clefting, and malocclusion. A comprehensive diagnostic assessment is essential to address the unique reconstructive needs in this congenital orofacial anomaly case, where patient selection is of paramount importance in optimizing treatment outcomes."
