  "Active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA; rheumatoid factor positive or negative polyarthritis and extended oligoarthritis), and juvenile psoriatic arthritis_1": "Patient A, a 13-year-old adolescent, presents with a complex rheumatologic condition. The patient has been experiencing persistent pain and swelling in multiple joints, with a severity rating of 7/10, despite previous treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Additionally, there is a notable presence of joint stiffness and limited range of motion, significantly impacting the patient's daily activities. Fatigue is also reported as a prominent symptom. Given the history of inadequate response to traditional DMARDs, the assessment of suitability and effectiveness of a tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitor is crucial in formulating an optimal treatment strategy for this patient.",
  "Active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA; rheumatoid factor positive or negative polyarthritis and extended oligoarthritis), and juvenile psoriatic arthritis_2": "Patient B, a 9-year-old child, is under evaluation for a rheumatologic condition characterized by polyarticular joint involvement. The patient's chief complaints include persistent pain and swelling in multiple joints, with a pain severity score of 6/10. Joint stiffness and limited range of motion are also reported, further hindering the child's mobility. In addition to the joint-related symptoms, the patient experiences significant fatigue. An assessment of the suitability and effectiveness of available treatment options, including tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors, is essential, considering the suboptimal response to initial therapy with DMARDs.",
  "Active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA; rheumatoid factor positive or negative polyarthritis and extended oligoarthritis), and juvenile psoriatic arthritis_3": "Patient C, a 15-year-old adolescent, presents with a challenging rheumatologic condition involving active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The patient reports persistent pain and swelling in multiple joints, with a pain score of 8/10, despite prior treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Joint stiffness and limited range of motion further contribute to the clinical picture, significantly impacting the patient's quality of life. Fatigue is also a notable symptom. Given the severity of the condition and the history of inadequate response to traditional DMARDs, the suitability and availability of advanced therapies, including TNF-alpha inhibitors and tofacitinib, need to be thoroughly evaluated as part of the comprehensive management plan."
