  "Bowel obstruction_1": "    Patient A, a 49-year-old male, presents with a complex abdominal condition. He has been experiencing persistent vomiting, with an increasing frequency over the past 24 hours. The vomitus is notable for its green color and has a bilious odor. Additionally, there is a significant increase in nasogastric aspirate, which also exhibits a greenish hue. The patient reports abdominal distension, accompanied by mild to moderate crampy abdominal pain (3-5 on a scale of 10). His bowel actions have been scanty, and he has not had a stool for the last two days. There is no history of recent surgeries or known abdominal adhesions. Diagnostic assessment is crucial, considering the distinctive bile presence in the vomitus and nasogastric aspirate, as well as the observed abdominal distension. It is essential to confirm the orders with the treating surgeon/doctor for proper catheter sizing to aid in the diagnosis and management of this challenging case.",
  "Bowel obstruction_2": "    Patient B, a 65-year-old female, is admitted with a concerning gastrointestinal presentation. She reports recurrent episodes of vomiting, which have become more frequent, with an average of 8-10 episodes per day. The vomitus is non-bilious and has a partially digested appearance. Furthermore, there is an increasing nasogastric aspirate, both in frequency and volume, without the presence of bile. The patient's abdomen is visibly distended, and she describes a persistent, crampy abdominal pain of 6/10 in intensity. Her bowel actions are minimal, with a formed consistency and a dark, tarry color, suggestive of occult blood. It is essential to evaluate the underlying cause of this patient's symptoms, given the recurrent non-bilious vomiting, increasing nasogastric aspirate, abdominal distension, and the concerning presence of occult blood in the stool.",
  "Bowel obstruction_3": "    Patient C, a 37-year-old male, seeks medical attention for gastrointestinal issues. He has been vomiting intermittently, with a frequency of 4-6 episodes per day, and the vomitus is a clear, non-bilious fluid. Over the last 24 hours, there has been a gradual increase in nasogastric aspirate, both in frequency and amount, without any bile content. The patient's abdomen is visibly distended, and he experiences mild, intermittent abdominal pain, rated at 2-3 on the pain scale. His bowel actions are scanty, and he has noted a decrease in frequency over the past two days, with loose, watery stools that contain no blood. Given the presence of non-bilious vomiting, increasing nasogastric aspirate, and abdominal distension, a comprehensive diagnostic assessment is necessary to determine the underlying etiology of his gastrointestinal symptoms."
