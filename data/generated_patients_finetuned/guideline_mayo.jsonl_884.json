  "Rubella_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 28-year-old female presented with a one-week history of a mild fever, fluctuating between 100-102\u00b0F, accompanied by a persistent headache and a stuffy nose. She reported a recent enlargement and tenderness of lymph nodes at the base of her skull, the back of her neck, and behind her ears. Additionally, the patient described the onset of a fine, pink rash, starting on her face and spreading quickly to her trunk, arms, and legs. She also complained of aching joints, which is noteworthy, given her demographic. The patient's medical history indicated that she had not received the rubella vaccination. Further assessment of her exposure history and the presence of these characteristic symptoms will be crucial in establishing a diagnosis.",
  "Rubella_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 32-year-old male, with no documented history of rubella vaccination, presented with a mild fever of 100.5\u00b0F, along with a persistent headache and red, itchy eyes. He reported a recent onset of enlarged and tender lymph nodes at the base of his skull, as well as behind his ears. The patient's travel history revealed a recent trip to a region where rubella is endemic. In addition to these symptoms, he experienced a fine, pink rash that emerged on his face and subsequently spread to his trunk, arms, and legs. Given the patient's travel to an area with a higher incidence of rubella, a thorough evaluation is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and assess the potential risk of transmission to others.",
  "Rubella_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 27-year-old pregnant woman presented with a mild fever, headache, and a stuffy nose, all of which had persisted for several days. She described enlarged and tender lymph nodes at the base of her skull, the back of her neck, and behind her ears. This patient also reported a fine, pink rash that started on her face and had spread to her trunk, arms, and legs. Importantly, her pregnancy status posed additional considerations for the evaluation and management of her condition. Given the presence of these characteristic symptoms and the patient's pregnancy, a prompt diagnostic assessment is essential to guide appropriate care for both the mother and the developing fetus."
