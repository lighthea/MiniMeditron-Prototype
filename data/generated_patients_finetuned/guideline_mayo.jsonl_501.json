  "Hives and Angioedema_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 45-year-old male patient presented with a recurring skin condition characterized by itchy welts of varying sizes, ranging from small spots to large blotches. The welts, which are skin-colored and occasionally reddish, appear on his arms, torso, and legs, with some taking on round or oval shapes. He also experiences episodes of swelling in the deeper layers of the skin, particularly around his face and lips, accompanied by mild pain and warmth in the affected areas. The patient's medical history is notable for a family background of hives and allergic reactions.",
  "Hives and Angioedema_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 30-year-old female patient with a history of allergic reactions and hives presented with skin manifestations consistent with hives and angioedema. She described experiencing intense itching associated with welts of various sizes, which can be skin-colored, reddish, or purplish on her brown skin. The welts range from small, pea-sized spots to larger, dinner plate-sized blotches. Additionally, the patient reported recurrent episodes of swelling in the deeper layers of her skin, especially around her face and lips. These symptoms are indicative of hereditary angioedema, given the family history of similar skin conditions.",
  "Hives and Angioedema_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 50-year-old male patient, known to have allergies to certain foods, presented with a bothersome skin condition. He described the presence of itchy welts on his body, varying in size and coloration. The welts appeared as skin-colored, reddish, or purplish spots, with some taking on round, oval, or worm-shaped forms. The patient's welts ranged from small to large, causing mild to moderate itching and discomfort. In addition to the welts, he also experienced recurring swelling in the deeper layers of his skin, particularly around his face and lips. The patient's known allergy to specific foods raised suspicion for an allergic etiology of his symptoms."
