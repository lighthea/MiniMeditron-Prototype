  "Hypoxic perinatal brain injury_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA full-term, 3-day-old male infant, born via normal spontaneous vaginal delivery to a 28-year-old mother, presents with concerning symptoms. The infant exhibited fetal distress during labor, and upon birth, umbilical cord blood gas analysis revealed acidosis. The baby's Apgar scores were 3 and 6 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The clinical presentation is notable for an altered level of consciousness and recurrent episodes of seizures. The gestational age of the infant is crucial in this case, as it impacts the diagnostic evaluation of the observed hypoxic perinatal brain injury. Further assessment and management are imperative to address the infant's condition and potential long-term neurological sequelae.",
  "Hypoxic perinatal brain injury_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 36-week-old newborn, delivered via emergency cesarean section due to fetal distress, is admitted with a worrisome clinical picture. The infant's birth was complicated by acidosis, as evidenced by umbilical cord blood gas analysis. Within 24 hours of birth, the baby's condition deteriorated, manifesting as respiratory distress, feeding difficulties, and an abnormal neurological examination, including hypotonia and reduced reflexes. Here, the context of the infant's gestational age significantly influences the diagnostic approach for the observed hypoxic perinatal brain injury. The clinical team must promptly initiate comprehensive evaluations and interventions to mitigate the impact of the condition on the infant's long-term neurodevelopment.",
  "Hypoxic perinatal brain injury_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 2-day-old female neonate, born at 41 weeks of gestation, presents a challenging clinical scenario. The infant experienced fetal distress during labor, and umbilical cord blood gas analysis at birth revealed significant acidosis. The neonate's postnatal course is marked by poor feeding, lethargy, and recurrent episodes of apnea. The context of the infant's gestational age is a critical factor impacting the diagnostic process for the observed hypoxic perinatal brain injury. Given the severity of the symptoms and the potential long-term consequences, comprehensive evaluation and management strategies are paramount to address the infant's condition and optimize her neurological outcomes."
