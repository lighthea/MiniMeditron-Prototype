  "Atelectasis_1": "    Description 1:\n    A 43-year-old male patient, non-smoker, with no significant medical history, presented with a persistent cough and wheezing. The cough has been rated at 5/10 in terms of severity and is non-productive. The patient reported difficulty breathing, which he described as intermittent but becoming more pronounced, reaching a pain level of 4/10 during episodes. He has also noticed rapid, shallow breathing, especially during physical activity. The symptoms have been present for the last three weeks and have not shown any improvement despite over-the-counter cough remedies. Considering the patient's escalating breathing difficulty, further diagnostic evaluation is warranted to determine the underlying cause and initiate prompt treatment.",
  "Atelectasis_2": "    Description 2:\n    A 58-year-old female patient, with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), presented with worsening respiratory symptoms. She reported a persistent, non-productive cough, which she rated at 6/10 in terms of severity. The cough is accompanied by wheezing, and the patient has noticed an increase in her baseline difficulty breathing, with episodes reaching a pain level of 6/10. She described her breathing as rapid and shallow, especially during the morning hours. Despite her regular COPD maintenance therapy, there has been a progressive exacerbation of symptoms over the past two weeks, prompting her to seek medical attention for further evaluation and management.",
  "Atelectasis_3": "    Description 3:\n    A 35-year-old male patient, admitted to the emergency department, presented with acute onset of severe difficulty breathing. The patient described his breathing difficulty as constant and rated the pain associated with it at 8/10 in intensity. He reported rapid, shallow breathing and pronounced wheezing. A non-productive cough was also noted. The patient had no significant past medical history or respiratory conditions. The onset of symptoms was sudden, and the worsening breathing difficulty prompted him to seek immediate medical help. In the absence of previous respiratory issues, a comprehensive diagnostic assessment is crucial to identify the underlying cause of his acute respiratory distress and initiate prompt treatment."
