  "Early-Stage Breast Cancer_1": "    Patient A, a 36-year-old woman, with a medical history of prior breast surgery, presented with concerning symptoms. She reported feeling a persistent, dull ache in her right breast, radiating towards the axilla, which she rated as 4/10 on the pain scale. Physical examination revealed palpable, enlarged axillary lymph nodes. Mammography and ultrasound demonstrated multicentric tumors, including ductal carcinoma in situ. The presence of nodal metastases was confirmed through imaging and biopsy. Given the patient's history and the observed clinical findings, the diagnostic work-up is crucial in determining the extent of the disease and formulating an appropriate treatment plan.",
  "Early-Stage Breast Cancer_3": "    A 44-year-old female patient, who had undergone prior breast surgery, presented with a complex clinical picture. She described a persistent, deep-seated pain in her left breast, which she rated as 6/10 in severity. On examination, there were palpable, enlarged axillary lymph nodes. Mammography and ultrasound revealed a large, locally advanced invasive breast cancer, with a primary tumor exceeding 5 cm in size. The presence of nodal metastases was confirmed through imaging and biopsy. The patient's history, coupled with the size of the tumor and the nodal involvement, poses diagnostic and treatment challenges that require a comprehensive approach.",
  "Early-Stage Breast Cancer_5": "    In our clinic, we evaluated a 29-year-old woman who presented with unique concerns. The patient, who was in her third trimester of pregnancy, reported unusual changes in her right breast. She described a persistent, throbbing pain with a severity rating of 5/10 and noted skin redness and warmth in the affected area. Physical examination revealed an erythematous and edematous appearance of the breast with peau d'orange skin. Given the clinical presentation and inflammatory features, a diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer was suspected. Further diagnostic work-up is warranted to assess the extent of the disease and its implications for the patient and her pregnancy."
