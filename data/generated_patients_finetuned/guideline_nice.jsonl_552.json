  "Locally advanced rectal cancer_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 57-year-old male patient with a significant smoking history presented with a chief complaint of rectal bleeding, which he described as moderate and intermittent, persisting for the past three months. He has also experienced increasing abdominal pain, which he rated as 6/10 on the pain scale. The pain is crampy and is often associated with a feeling of rectal obstruction. Digital rectal examination revealed a palpable mass in the rectum, and the patient reported a change in bowel habits. Given the patient's age and the presence of obstructive symptoms, further evaluation is warranted to determine the underlying etiology of his symptoms.",
  "Locally advanced rectal cancer_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 45-year-old female patient, with no significant medical history, presented with a three-month history of recurrent rectal bleeding. The bleeding episodes have become more frequent, and she described them as moderately heavy, leading to persistent fatigue. In addition to the bleeding, the patient reported a bothersome anal pain, which she rated as 5/10 in severity. She also noticed a foul-smelling discharge from the rectum. Physical examination revealed signs of anemia, and digital rectal exam showed a palpable mass. Given the persistent nature of her symptoms and the presence of discharge, further diagnostic workup is crucial to determine the underlying pathology.",
  "Locally advanced rectal cancer_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 65-year-old male patient, known for a family history of colorectal cancer, presented with a complex set of symptoms. He reported a six-month history of intermittent rectal bleeding, which he initially attributed to hemorrhoids. However, the bleeding has persisted, and he now experiences sharp rectal pain, rated at 7/10 in intensity, along with a new onset of bowel obstruction. The patient also described episodes of abdominal pain and noted unintentional weight loss. Digital rectal examination revealed an ulcerated, fixed mass in the rectum. Given the patient's age, family history, and the presence of tumor-related pain and obstruction, an urgent diagnostic assessment is necessary to establish the nature of the underlying condition."
