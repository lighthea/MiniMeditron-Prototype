The patient's understanding of their gender identity is clear, and they have been experiencing this incongruence since early adolescence.

  "Gender Dysphoria/Gender Incongruence_2": "Patient B, a 16-year-old adolescent, is brought in by their parents due to concerns regarding gender dysphoria. The patient has been expressing a profound incongruence between their gender identity and the gender assigned at birth, which has been a source of significant distress and discomfort. They exhibit a strong, persistent desire to be recognized and treated as a gender different from their assigned one. Given their pubertal status, the impact of these feelings on their mental health and overall well-being is substantial. The patient is supported by their family, and there is a notable understanding of gender identity within their social environment. No prior gender-affirming treatments have been initiated. It is imperative to conduct a comprehensive assessment, taking into account the patient's developmental stage, mental health, and social context to guide an appropriate management approach.",
