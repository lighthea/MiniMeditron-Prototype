  "Eye melanoma_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 45-year-old Caucasian male presented with a noticeable change in his vision characterized by the perception of floaters and occasional flashes in his right eye. He described a persistent sensation of specks of dust obstructing his visual field, which he rated at 4/10 on the pain scale. On examination, a growing dark spot on the iris and an altered shape of the pupil were observed. The patient reported a history of frequent outdoor activities without adequate eye protection. Given the combination of symptoms, demographic factors, and lifestyle, further ophthalmological evaluation is warranted to explore the underlying etiology.",
  "Eye melanoma_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 55-year-old female with light-colored eyes reported a concerning visual issue in her left eye, described as poor and blurry vision (7/10 on the pain scale). She also noticed a progressive change in the shape of the dark circle at the center of her eye. Clinical examination revealed a notable dark spot on the iris and a documented loss of peripheral vision in the affected eye. The patient had a family history of certain inherited skin disorders. These findings, along with the patient's demographic background and hereditary factors, highlight the importance of a comprehensive eye examination to determine the nature of her ocular condition.",
  "Eye melanoma_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 60-year-old male patient, who had a history of chronic sun exposure and outdoor occupation, presented with a growing dark spot on the iris of his right eye. He reported a sensation of floaters and flashes in his visual field, which he rated at 5/10 in terms of discomfort. Additionally, the patient noticed a change in the shape of the pupil and a persistent, poor vision in the affected eye. Given his occupational and lifestyle factors, along with the observed ocular symptoms, there is a compelling need for a thorough ophthalmic assessment to elucidate the underlying cause of his presenting issues."
