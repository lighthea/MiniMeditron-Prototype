  "Acute Leukemia_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 45-year-old male, with no significant medical history, presented with increasing fatigue, palpitations, and shortness of breath over the past month, which he rates at 6/10 in severity. He reported a noticeable decrease in his exercise tolerance and intermittent fever. Physical examination revealed pallor and petechiae on his skin. Laboratory results indicated severe anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8 g/dL. The patient's leukocyte count was markedly elevated at 120,000/\u03bcL, with 70% blast cells on the peripheral blood smear. A bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy were performed, showing hypercellularity with 80% blast cells. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed the presence of abnormal myeloid blasts. Given the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings, further molecular characterization and mutational analysis are warranted to guide the treatment approach.",
  "Acute Leukemia_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 28-year-old female, without significant past medical history, presented with a two-week history of persistent fever, night sweats, and generalized weakness, which she described as 7/10 in severity. The patient reported easy bruising and recurrent nosebleeds. On examination, there were multiple ecchymoses on her limbs, and she had hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory investigations revealed pancytopenia, with a hemoglobin level of 9 g/dL, platelet count of 40,000/\u03bcL, and a white blood cell count of 2,000/\u03bcL, with 80% blast cells on the peripheral smear. Bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy demonstrated hypercellularity with 85% blast cells. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed the presence of abnormal lymphoid blasts. Molecular characterization, including Pediatric B-ALL testing, is essential for further risk stratification and treatment planning.",
  "Acute Leukemia_3": "    Patient Description 3:\n    A 60-year-old male, with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) treated with azacitidine, presented with worsening fatigue and recurrent infections. He described his fatigue as 5/10 in severity and reported unintentional weight loss. Physical examination was notable for pallor, and the patient had no evidence of bleeding or organomegaly. Laboratory findings showed pancytopenia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, platelet count of 50,000/\u03bcL, and a white blood cell count of 3,000/\u03bcL, with 60% blast cells on the peripheral smear. The bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy revealed dysplastic changes and 70% blast cells. Given the patient's history of MDS and the transformation to acute leukemia, molecular characterization, including mutational analysis for selected genes and assessment of treatment response, is crucial to guide further management."
