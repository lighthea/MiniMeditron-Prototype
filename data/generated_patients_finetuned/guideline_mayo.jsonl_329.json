  "Dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs)_1": "Patient A, a 65-year-old male, presents with a complex array of neurological symptoms. He reports a persistent, throbbing headache with a severity level of 6/10, accompanied by episodes of nausea and vomiting. Additionally, he experiences difficulty in walking, often resulting in falls, and has noticed a gradual decline in his cognitive function, exhibiting signs of dementia and apathy. His medical history is significant for non-hemorrhaging neurological deficits (NHNDs) and increased pressure in the brain. On examination, he displays coordination issues, weakness in the lower limbs, and a subtle speech impairment. Given the constellation of symptoms and the contextual factors, a comprehensive neurovascular assessment is warranted to elucidate the underlying etiology.",
  "Dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs)_2": "Patient B is a 50-year-old female who presents with a myriad of neurological and visual complaints. She describes a persistent facial pain characterized as a burning sensation, with an intensity level of 7/10, localized around her left eye. In addition to this, she has been experiencing double vision, balance difficulties, and a progressive deterioration in her visual acuity. On examination, bulging of the left eye, swelling in the eye lining, and eye-related palsies are noted. Notably, the patient has a family history of genetic predisposition to blood clots. These symptoms, coupled with her familial predisposition, raise concerns regarding a complex underlying condition. A comprehensive diagnostic workup is imperative to determine the nature of her presentation.",
  "Dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs)_3": "Patient C, a 42-year-old male, presents with a concerning mix of neurological and auditory symptoms. He reports recurrent, severe headaches with a pain level of 8/10, often accompanied by episodes of pulsatile tinnitus in his left ear. Moreover, he has been experiencing coordination issues, frequent seizures, and a gradual loss of vision in his left eye. His medical history is significant for a traumatic head injury. On examination, he exhibits hearing issues, specifically a bruit behind the left ear, along with balance difficulties. The combination of neurological and auditory symptoms, in the context of a previous head injury, necessitates a comprehensive evaluation to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology."
