  "Acute Otitis Media (AOM)_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 6-year-old male patient, with a history of cochlear implant, was brought in by his parents with a chief complaint of severe right-sided ear pain, which he has been experiencing for the past 2 days. The pain is described as 8/10 in intensity and has been associated with a low-grade fever of 100.4\u00b0F. The child has also exhibited loss of appetite and a single episode of vomiting. On examination, he appears lethargic. Given the presence of a cochlear implant, it is crucial to consider the heightened risk of acute otitis media in this patient.",
