  "Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Adults_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    \n    A 58-year-old postmenopausal female patient presents with a complex medical history, including hypertension and obesity. The patient's chief complaint revolves around disruptive snoring, often accompanied by gasping and choking episodes during sleep, as reported by her family members. Despite obtaining what seems like an adequate amount of sleep, the patient experiences excessive daytime sleepiness, which she rates as 8/10 on the pain scale, significantly impacting her quality of life.
