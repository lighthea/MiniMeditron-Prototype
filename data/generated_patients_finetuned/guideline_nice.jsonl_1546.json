  "Stress urinary incontinence in women_1": "    Patient A, a 42-year-old woman, presents with a distressing concern of urinary incontinence. She reports a consistent involuntary leakage of urine during physical activities, including exercise and sudden movements such as coughing, sneezing, and laughing. The frequency of these episodes has notably increased over the last six months, significantly impacting her confidence and quality of life. Notably, she has a history of three vaginal deliveries, which may have contributed to weakened pelvic floor muscles. Initial interventions, including pelvic floor exercises, have shown limited efficacy in addressing her symptoms.",
  "Stress urinary incontinence in women_2": "    Patient B, a 55-year-old woman, seeks medical evaluation for a bothersome issue related to urinary incontinence. She describes the involuntary leakage of urine during activities that involve physical exertion or sudden movements, such as coughing, sneezing, and laughing. These episodes have been occurring with increasing frequency, causing her substantial distress. Additionally, she reports a history of pelvic surgery, which could have contributed to the weakening of the muscles and connective tissues in her pelvic floor. Despite attempting lifestyle modifications, the symptom frequency and severity have remained largely unchanged.",
  "Stress urinary incontinence in women_3": "    Patient C, a 38-year-old woman, presents with a significant concern of urinary incontinence. She experiences bothersome episodes of involuntary urine leakage, particularly during exercise and moments of increased intra-abdominal pressure, such as coughing, sneezing, and laughing. These symptoms have been ongoing for the past year and have progressively worsened, leading to heightened anxiety and a decreased willingness to engage in physical activities. Notably, the patient has a history of chronic cough due to smoking, which may have contributed to the exacerbation of her condition. Previous attempts at pelvic floor muscle exercises have provided minimal relief."
