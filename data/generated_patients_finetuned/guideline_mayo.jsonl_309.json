  "DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome)_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 9-month-old male infant with a complex medical history presented with a constellation of concerning symptoms. The patient exhibits a heart murmur and bluish skin discoloration, indicative of poor circulation of oxygen-rich blood, with the severity of the cyanosis corresponding to decreased oxygen saturation levels. Furthermore, he has experienced recurrent infections, contributing to the diagnostic assessment. Physical examination revealed certain facial features characteristic of the condition, including an underdeveloped chin and wide-set eyes. The presence of a cleft palate further adds to the diagnostic considerations. The timing of these signs and symptoms aligns with the age-related milestones, with delayed growth, feeding difficulties, and poor muscle tone noted. Given these clinical manifestations and the patient's medical history, an in-depth evaluation is paramount to determine the underlying etiology of this complex presentation.",
  "DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome)_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 4-year-old female patient, with a history of early developmental delays, visited our clinic with a spectrum of concerning symptoms. The child exhibits a persistent heart murmur, and episodes of bluish skin discoloration have been observed during periods of exertion, indicative of reduced oxygenation. Furthermore, she has a documented history of frequent infections. The presence of certain facial features, including low-set ears and a narrow groove in the upper lip, is noted upon physical examination. The patient also experiences delayed speech development, with nasal-sounding speech. These features, in conjunction with learning delays and behavioral problems, warrant a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to elucidate the underlying etiology of her condition.",
  "DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome)_3": "    Patient Description 3:\n    A 7-year-old male child, without significant prior medical issues, was referred to our clinic due to a complex array of symptoms. The patient exhibits a heart murmur and intermittent bluish skin discoloration, associated with episodes of exertional dyspnea, reflecting poor oxygen circulation. Notably, he has a history of frequent infections. Physical examination revealed certain facial features, including wide-set eyes and a narrow groove in the upper lip. The child experiences learning delays and has been struggling with recurrent behavioral problems. Given the presence of these symptoms and the patient's medical history, a thorough diagnostic assessment is crucial to identify and address the underlying condition."
