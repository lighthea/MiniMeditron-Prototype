  "Diabetic Foot_1": " 1. A 63-year-old male patient with a long-standing history of type 2 diabetes presented with a complex constellation of symptoms. The patient reported a persistent, burning pain (rated 6/10 on the visual analog scale) in both feet, consistent with peripheral neuropathy. Physical examination revealed foot deformities and previous amputation of the left great toe. Importantly, an open wound was observed on the plantar aspect of the right foot, which had not responded to empirical treatment. The presence of bone abnormalities, including deformities and destruction, was noted on radiographic imaging. Vascular examination and ankle-brachial index measurements are crucial in this case to assess pedal perfusion and determine the extent of the diabetic foot condition, as the patient's history and the combination of symptoms raise concern for diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO).",
  "Diabetic Foot_2": "2. A 55-year-old female patient with a history of poorly controlled type 1 diabetes presented with a complex lower extremity condition. The patient reported aching and shooting pain (rated 7/10) in her feet, indicative of peripheral neuropathy. Physical examination revealed foot deformities and a healed diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) on the left foot. Additionally, there were nonplantar wounds with inadequate culture information, raising concerns about the potential for underlying diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO). Given the patient's nonplantar DFUs, the diagnostic evaluation should include a comprehensive assessment of vascular perfusion, as pedal perfusion and the presence of radiopaque foreign bodies may further inform the diagnostic process.",
  "Diabetic Foot_3": "3. A 70-year-old male patient with a prolonged history of type 2 diabetes presented with a concerning lower extremity condition. The patient described a chronic, throbbing pain (rated 8/10) in both feet, consistent with severe peripheral neuropathy. Physical examination revealed foot deformities, previous toe amputations, and a non-healing open wound on the plantar aspect of the right foot. Radiographic imaging showed evidence of soft tissue gas and bone abnormalities, including destruction, raising a high index of suspicion for diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO). The presence of an open plantar DFU necessitates a thorough assessment, including vascular examination and ankle-brachial index measurements, to evaluate pedal perfusion and guide the diagnostic process in this challenging case."
