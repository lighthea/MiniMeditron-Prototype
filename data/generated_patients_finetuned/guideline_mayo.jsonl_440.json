  "Granuloma annulare_1": "    Patient 1, a 25-year-old adult, presents with a concerning skin condition. They have a circular rash with a diameter of approximately 2 inches on the dorsal aspect of both hands and feet. The rash has been persistent for the past six weeks and is accompanied by mild itching (rated 3/10 for pain). The patient has no history of minor skin injuries, insect bites, or exposure to unusual medications. However, they do have a family history of autoimmune diseases. Physical examination reveals raised bumps in a ring pattern on the affected areas, consistent with the presentation of granuloma annulare. Further evaluation is warranted to determine the underlying cause and initiate an appropriate treatment plan.",
  "Granuloma annulare_2": "    Patient 2, a 35-year-old adult, seeks medical attention for a widespread skin rash. The patient reports the development of numerous small, firm lumps under the skin on their hands, shins, and scalp, which have coalesced to form a rash covering most of their body, including the trunk, arms, and legs. The rash is non-pruritic but has caused the patient significant distress due to its cosmetic impact. There is no history of recent insect bites, minor skin injuries, or medication changes. However, the patient has been diagnosed with diabetes, which is adequately managed with medication. Physical examination reveals the characteristic appearance of granuloma annulare lesions. Given the extent of the rash and the patient's medical history, a comprehensive assessment is essential to address this dermatological manifestation in the context of their underlying diabetes.",
  "Granuloma annulare_3": "    Patient 3, a 6-year-old child, is brought in by their parents due to the presence of skin lesions. The child has multiple raised bumps in a ring pattern on their hands and feet, as well as the anterior aspect of the shins. These skin lesions have been persistent for the past two months and are not associated with any itching or discomfort. The parents deny any history of minor skin injuries or insect bites. The child's medical history is unremarkable, with no significant systemic illnesses. Physical examination confirms the presence of small, firm lumps consistent with granuloma annulare. Given the age of the patient, further assessment and monitoring are necessary to ensure an appropriate management approach for this pediatric presentation."
