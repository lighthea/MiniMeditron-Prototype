  "Renal tumour_1": "Patient A, a 52-year-old male, presents with a concerning medical history of intermittent dull pain in the right flank, radiating towards the back, persisting for the past four months. The pain, rated at 4/10 in intensity, has not responded to over-the-counter analgesics. Additionally, he has noticed a gradual but unexplained weight loss of 8 pounds over the last three months, despite maintaining a stable diet and exercise routine. Notably, there are no other urinary symptoms. A recent abdominal imaging study revealed a solid renal mass, approximately 5 cm in size, located peripherally in the right kidney. The patient has a normal contralateral kidney. Given the clinical presentation and the nature of the renal tumour, further diagnostic evaluation and intervention are warranted.",
  "Renal tumour_2": "Patient B, a 64-year-old female, with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease, presents with a localized abnormality in her left kidney, incidentally discovered during a routine renal function assessment. The patient is asymptomatic and denies any flank pain, hematuria, or constitutional symptoms. Physical examination is unremarkable. Imaging studies reveal a small, solid renal tumour, measuring 3.5 cm, situated centrally within the left kidney. Given the patient's comorbidities and the position of the tumour, close monitoring and a comprehensive diagnostic workup are essential to determine the nature of the renal mass and guide further management.",
  "Renal tumour_3": "Patient C, a 45-year-old otherwise healthy individual, reports persistent discomfort in the right flank, with an intermittent sharp pain rated at 6/10 in severity. The pain has been ongoing for two months and occasionally extends towards the lower back. Although there are no urinary symptoms, the patient has experienced episodes of night sweats and a noticeable decrease in appetite, leading to an unintentional weight loss of 10 pounds over the past three months. A subsequent imaging study identifies a solid renal tumour, approximately 6 cm in size, located centrally in the right kidney. Given the patient's atypical symptoms and the position of the tumour, further diagnostic assessment and a multidisciplinary approach are imperative to address the underlying condition."
