  "Amblyopia_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 6-year-old patient, with no significant medical history, was brought in by their parents for an ophthalmologic evaluation. The child has been experiencing a persistent reduced visual acuity in one eye, which the parents noticed during daily activities such as reading or watching television. Despite interventions, including adequate corrective lenses, the visual acuity issue persists. The child also exhibits poor depth perception, often struggling with tasks that require hand-eye coordination. Furthermore, the parents have observed the child squinting or closing one eye to see better, particularly when engaged in activities that demand focused visual attention. The diagnostic process may be influenced by the child's age and level of cooperation during the assessment.",
