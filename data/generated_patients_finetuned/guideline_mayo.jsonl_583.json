  "Lazy eye (amblyopia)_1": "Patient A, a 6-year-old male, was brought in by his parents for an ophthalmologic evaluation. The parents reported observing an intermittent inward wandering of the left eye, particularly when the child was fatigued or viewing distant objects. The patient demonstrated a tendency to squint his left eye in brightly lit environments. Additionally, he exhibited poor depth perception, as noted by frequent misjudgments of distance and clumsiness during play activities. His birth history was unremarkable, with no prematurity or low birth weight. There is no reported family history of eye disorders. The initial vision screening test revealed abnormal results, prompting further assessment for a definitive diagnosis.",
  "Lazy eye (amblyopia)_2": "Patient B, a 4-year-old female, presented with a concerning ocular symptomatology. Her parents reported a persistent outward deviation of the right eye, especially when she focused on near objects or during periods of prolonged visual tasks. The child frequently shut her right eye while reading or watching television. Additionally, she was observed to tilt her head to one side when attempting to look at objects directly. The family history was notable for a relative with a history of lazy eye. The patient's developmental milestones were otherwise normal. An initial vision screening test yielded abnormal results, prompting a comprehensive ophthalmic assessment to determine the underlying etiology of her symptoms.",
  "Lazy eye (amblyopia)_3": "Patient C, a 7-year-old male, was referred for an ophthalmologic consultation due to parental concerns regarding his ocular health. The parents reported that the child's eyes appeared to not work together, with intermittent episodes of misalignment and a lack of coordination between the two eyes, particularly when viewing distant objects or engaging in visually demanding tasks. The patient displayed a persistent head tilt to the right side, which was more noticeable during reading and writing activities. His birth history was unremarkable, and there were no reported developmental disabilities. However, there was a family history of lazy eye in a first-degree relative. The initial vision screening tests revealed abnormal findings, warranting a comprehensive evaluation to assess the nature and extent of the visual impairment."
