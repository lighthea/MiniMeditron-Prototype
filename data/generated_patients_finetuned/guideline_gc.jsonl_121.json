  "Pulmonary Hypertension Due to Left Heart Disease_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 62-year-old male patient, with a significant medical history of chronic systolic heart failure, presented with exertional dyspnea (NYHA class II), which has progressively worsened over the past six months. He reports feeling fatigued after minimal physical activity, such as climbing a flight of stairs. The dyspnea is often accompanied by an oppressive sensation in his chest, rated at 6/10 in intensity, and which partially resolves with rest. He has no history of atrial fibrillation. Physical examination revealed stable clinical conditions, with a regular sinus rhythm and the presence of a significant v-wave. Echocardiography demonstrated left ventricular systolic dysfunction and an intermediate probability of pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease (PH-LHD). The patient's risk factors for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) are not identified.",
  "Pulmonary Hypertension Due to Left Heart Disease_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 56-year-old female patient, known for her long-standing hypertension and obesity, presented with a six-month history of exertional dyspnea (NYHA class II-III). She described her dyspnea as a smothering sensation in the chest, with an intensity of 7/10, often limiting her ability to perform household chores or walk moderate distances. The symptom is accompanied by occasional palpitations, but she has no documented history of atrial fibrillation. On examination, the patient's clinical condition was stable, and she exhibited a sinus rhythm with no significant v-wave. Echocardiography revealed left ventricular hypertrophy and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, indicating an intermediate probability of pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease (PH-LHD). The patient's risk factors for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) are not evident.",
  "Pulmonary Hypertension Due to Left Heart Disease_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 60-year-old male patient, with a history of untreated hypertension, presented with a six-month history of progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion (NYHA class II-III). He described his dyspnea as a constricting sensation in the chest, rated at 8/10 in intensity, often necessitating frequent breaks during physical activities. The symptom is not associated with palpitations, and the patient has a documented history of atrial fibrillation. On examination, his clinical condition was stable, and he exhibited a sinus rhythm with the presence of a prominent v-wave. Echocardiography showed left ventricular hypertrophy, a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, and the presence of a right ventricular abnormality, indicating an intermediate to high probability of pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease (PH-LHD). The patient's risk factors for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) are not identified."
