  "Liver hemangioma_1": "    Patient A, a 38-year-old woman who is currently on hormone replacement therapy, presented with persistent dull pain (rated 4/10 on the visual analog scale) in her upper right abdomen. She reported experiencing early satiety, often feeling full shortly after beginning a meal, accompanied by episodes of nausea and occasional vomiting. Her medical history is significant for long-term use of hormone control medications. These symptoms have been ongoing for the past six weeks, and previous treatments, including dietary modifications, have provided minimal relief. Given the patient's age, sex, and hormonal medication use, the diagnostic approach should consider the possibility of a hepatic condition.",
  "Liver hemangioma_2": "    Patient B, a 45-year-old male, sought medical attention for recurrent pain (rated 6/10 on the visual analog scale) in his upper right abdomen. He described a persistent sensation of early satiety, whereby small amounts of food would make him feel excessively full. The early satiety was often accompanied by nausea and occasional episodes of vomiting. Notably, the patient has no significant medical history or current medication use. These symptoms have been troubling him for the last two months, and over-the-counter antacids provided minimal relief. Given the patient's age and sex, the presence of these symptoms warrants a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to elucidate the underlying cause of his hepatic discomfort.",
  "Liver hemangioma_3": "    Patient C, a 30-year-old woman who is currently pregnant, reported persistent pain (rated 5/10 on the visual analog scale) in her upper right abdomen. She frequently experienced early satiety, feeling full after consuming small amounts of food, and suffered from recurrent episodes of nausea and vomiting. The symptoms have been ongoing for the past four weeks and have not responded to conservative measures. Due to the patient's pregnancy status, the diagnostic approach should be tailored to accommodate her unique physiological condition and explore the etiology of her hepatic-related complaints while ensuring the safety of investigative procedures for both the mother and the fetus."
