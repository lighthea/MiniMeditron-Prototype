  "Preeclampsia_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 28-year-old pregnant woman, G2P1 (gravida 2, para 1), at 32 weeks of gestation, presented with a blood pressure reading of 150/95 mmHg, indicating high blood pressure. Notably, she has a pertinent medical history, as her first pregnancy was complicated by preeclampsia, which necessitated preterm delivery. She describes occasional frontal headaches, rated at 4/10 in intensity, and mild epigastric discomfort. The patient has no history of hypertension outside of pregnancy, and her current body mass index (BMI) is within normal limits. Physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities, other than an elevated blood pressure. Due to her history of preeclampsia and the onset of high blood pressure in the third trimester, a careful monitoring plan and further diagnostic evaluations are warranted to assess the severity of her condition and guide appropriate management.",
  "Preeclampsia_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 35-year-old primigravida woman at 29 weeks of gestation presented with elevated blood pressure, measuring 160/110 mmHg. She reports a family history of preeclampsia in her mother's pregnancies. The patient's blood pressure has been gradually increasing over the past two weeks, and she has developed persistent headaches located in the frontal and temporal regions, with an intensity of 6/10. She also describes visual disturbances, including occasional episodes of blurry vision. Physical examination is notable for generalized pitting edema and a body mass index (BMI) in the overweight range. Given her family history of preeclampsia, the escalating blood pressure, persistent headaches, and visual disturbances, an urgent diagnostic workup is essential to evaluate the severity of her condition and determine the most appropriate management approach.",
  "Preeclampsia_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 30-year-old pregnant woman, G3P2 (gravida 3, para 2), at 36 weeks of gestation, was referred to the obstetric clinic for evaluation of high blood pressure, with readings consistently above 140/90 mmHg. She has a history of preeclampsia in her previous pregnancy, which required antenatal monitoring and resulted in a preterm delivery. The patient reports occasional right upper quadrant abdominal pain, rated at 3/10 in intensity, and mild shortness of breath. Her medical history is notable for an elevated BMI. On examination, she exhibits mild edema in the lower extremities. Given her history of preeclampsia, recurrent high blood pressure in the third trimester, and the presence of right upper quadrant pain, a comprehensive assessment is essential to determine the severity of her current condition and make informed decisions regarding the optimal management strategy."
