  "Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformations (CCAM), Sacrococcygeal teratomas_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 32-year-old pregnant woman, G5P2, at 28 weeks of gestation, presented with concerning fetal conditions. She reported increased fetal activity and noted polyhydramnios. On fetal ultrasound, a large tumor was observed in the thoracic cavity, leading to cardiomegaly and placentomegaly. The fetus showed signs of in utero heart failure, manifesting as non-immune hydrops fetalis. The patient's medical history is unremarkable, with no prior complications during her previous pregnancies. Given the observed symptoms and the rapid growth of the tumor, there is a heightened concern for the stress on the fetal heart, necessitating a comprehensive diagnostic approach to guide further management.",
  "Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformations (CCAM), Sacrococcygeal teratomas_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 30-year-old woman, G3P0, at 30 weeks of gestation, presented with a complex fetal condition. Fetal ultrasound revealed a sizeable tumor in the thoracic cavity, leading to cardiomegaly and placentomegaly. The patient had a history of infertility and conceived through in vitro fertilization. She experienced preterm labor contractions, although no cervical changes were noted on examination. The fetus's heart exhibited signs of stress, and there were indications of non-immune hydrops fetalis. Given the combination of symptoms, including the large tumor size, high growth rate, and preterm labor, a prompt and thorough diagnostic evaluation is crucial to determine the optimal management strategy and the impact on maternal and fetal health.",
  "Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformations (CCAM), Sacrococcygeal teratomas_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 28-year-old pregnant woman, G2P1, at 32 weeks of gestation, presented with an unusual fetal presentation. Fetal ultrasound revealed a large tumor in the thorax, leading to cardiomegaly and placentomegaly. The patient had a history of a previous cesarean section. She reported fetal distress and dystocia-like sensations. The fetus showed signs of in utero heart failure, and non-immune hydrops fetalis was evident. The observed tumor's size and the presence of cardiomegaly, combined with the history of dystocia, raise concerns about the well-being of the fetus and the impending labor process. A comprehensive diagnostic assessment is warranted to guide decision-making and facilitate appropriate interventions for the maternal and fetal conditions."
