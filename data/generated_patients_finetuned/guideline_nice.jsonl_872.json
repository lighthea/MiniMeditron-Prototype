  "early Dupuytren\u2019s contractures_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 56-year-old male patient, with a significant family history of hand-related conditions, presented with concerning symptoms indicative of early Dupuytren\u2019s contractures. He reported a gradual onset of reduced range of motion in his fingers, notably in the 4th and 5th digits, which has progressed over the past 12 months. The patient described intermittent but distressing pain, with a severity rating of 5/10, localized to the affected areas.
