The patient has a history of immunosuppressant toxicity, and her nonadherence to prescribed medications has been noted. Additionally, she has developed diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Given her recurrent health issues, close monitoring of immunosuppressant levels and comprehensive diabetes management are imperative. The patient's lifestyle includes a high alcohol intake, adding complexity to her case and necessitating interventions for substance abuse.",
  "Liver Transplantation_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 40-year-old male patient, post-liver transplantation, presented with a notable medical history and a constellation of symptoms. He reports a long-term history of smoking and alcohol intake. The patient is at risk for infection due to nonadherence to immunosuppressant therapy. He also exhibits abnormal liver function tests and is at an increased risk of skin cancer. Given his lifestyle behaviors, close monitoring for recurrent hepatoblastoma and liver function is essential. Furthermore, the patient's immunization history and screening for colon cancer should be diligently tracked as part of his post-transplant care plan. A comprehensive approach is needed to address the multiple risk factors and complications in this case."
