  "Testicular torsion_1": "    Patient A, a 22-year-old male, presented with sudden and severe scrotal pain, which he described as 9/10 on the pain scale. The onset of pain was not associated with any trauma or injury. He also reported mild scrotal swelling. Physical examination revealed tenderness and a slightly swollen left scrotum. The patient has no significant medical history. Considering the acute onset of high-intensity scrotal pain and the presence of scrotal swelling, testicular torsion is a primary diagnostic consideration. Further evaluation and intervention are imperative to prevent potential testicular ischemia.",
  "Testicular torsion_2": "    Patient B, a 16-year-old adolescent, was brought to the emergency department by his parents due to non-painful swelling of the scrotum, which they had noticed for the past two days. The patient denied any history of scrotal trauma. On examination, a painless enlargement of the right scrotum was observed. The patient's medical history is unremarkable. Although the absence of pain is atypical, the non-painful scrotal swelling raises concern, especially in the absence of a clear traumatic event. Diagnostic assessment is crucial to ascertain the underlying cause of the scrotal swelling in this adolescent.",
  "Testicular torsion_3": "    Patient C, a 4-month-old male infant, was brought in by his caregiver with a complaint of scrotal swelling and irritability. The caregiver reported no history of scrotal trauma. Physical examination revealed a tender and enlarged right scrotum. The infant's medical history is significant for prematurity but is otherwise unremarkable. Given the age of the patient and the presence of scrotal swelling accompanied by tenderness, the clinician must consider the possibility of testicular torsion, even in the absence of a definitive history of trauma. Additional evaluation is crucial to determine the underlying etiology of the scrotal symptoms in this infant."
