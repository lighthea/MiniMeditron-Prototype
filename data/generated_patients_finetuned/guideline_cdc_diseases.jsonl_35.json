  "Ross River virus disease_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 45-year-old male patient presented with a four-week history of progressively worsening joint pain and swelling, predominantly affecting the wrists, knees, and ankles. The pain is rated as 7/10 in intensity and is associated with joint stiffness, particularly in the morning. He also reported diffuse muscle pain and a persistent low-grade fever of 38.5\u00b0C. The patient described a general feeling of tiredness, which has been impacting his daily activities. Notably, he developed a rash on his trunk and extremities. The patient has a significant outdoor lifestyle and recalls multiple mosquito bites in the weeks preceding the onset of symptoms. No specific treatments have been initiated. Further evaluation is warranted to determine the underlying etiology of these manifestations.",

She described the pain as 6/10 in intensity and noted its involvement in multiple joints, including the hands, wrists, and knees. The joint pain was accompanied by muscle pain and a recurrent low-grade fever. The patient reported persistent tiredness, which she attributed to her joint-related discomfort. Additionally, she exhibited a rash on her lower extremities. The symptoms began after a camping trip in a region known for increased mosquito activity. The patient has not received any prior interventions for these complaints. Given the clinical presentation and the patient's history, a comprehensive diagnostic assessment is essential to elucidate the nature of her condition.",
  "Ross River virus disease_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 50-year-old male patient presented with a six-week history of joint pain and swelling, predominantly affecting the knees and ankles. He described the pain as 8/10 in intensity and reported associated joint stiffness, particularly in the morning and after prolonged periods of inactivity. The pain was concomitant with generalized muscle pain and a persistent low-grade fever. The patient expressed feelings of tiredness, which he attributed to his physical symptoms. Furthermore, he exhibited a rash on his trunk and upper extremities. Notably, the patient had recently returned from a travel excursion to a region where mosquitoes are prevalent. No prior treatments have been administered. Given the patient's outdoor activities and travel history, a comprehensive diagnostic workup is crucial to determine the underlying etiology of his presenting symptoms."
