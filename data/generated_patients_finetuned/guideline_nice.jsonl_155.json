  "Coronary artery disease_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 58-year-old male patient with a history of cigarette smoking and a sedentary lifestyle presented with recurring episodes of angina. The chest pain, which he rated as 6/10 in severity, consistently worsens during physical exertion and is relieved with rest. Despite being prescribed sublingual nitroglycerin, the frequency of his anginal episodes has increased over the past three months. His diagnostic evaluation is significant for the deposition of atherosclerotic plaque, and further assessment is warranted to determine the extent of critical reduction in blood supply to the heart.",
  "Coronary artery disease_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 64-year-old female patient, known for her family history of coronary artery disease, presented to the emergency department with acute-onset myocardial infarction. She described the chest pain as excruciating, with a severity rating of 9/10, accompanied by diaphoresis and shortness of breath. The pain, which radiated to her left arm and jaw, persisted for over 30 minutes and was unresponsive to sublingual nitroglycerin. ECG findings confirmed the myocardial infarction, prompting immediate intervention. The patient's pre-existing risk factors and the observed acute event underscore the critical importance of managing her condition comprehensively.",
  "Coronary artery disease_3": "    Patient Description 3:\n    A 60-year-old male patient, previously diagnosed with coronary artery disease and managed with lifestyle modifications and medication, was found unresponsive at home. Despite resuscitation efforts, he succumbed to a sudden cardiac death. The patient's medical history revealed non-compliance with prescribed medications and a lack of regular follow-up visits for the past year. Autopsy findings confirmed the cause of death as related to his underlying coronary artery disease, emphasizing the grave consequences of suboptimal disease management and patient adherence."
