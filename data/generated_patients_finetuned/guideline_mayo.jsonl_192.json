  "Central nervous system vascular malformations_1": "    Patient A, a 45-year-old individual with a pertinent medical history, presents with recurrent neurological symptoms. They have been experiencing severe, episodic headaches, which they self-report as 8/10 in intensity. Additionally, the patient has had two episodes of seizures in the last six months, prompting their visit. Neurological deficits are also evident, particularly affecting their speech and memory. Notably, there is a family history of stroke, adding to the diagnostic considerations. Physical examination reveals the presence of a bruit, indicative of fast blood flow through a vascular malformation. Further evaluation is warranted to ascertain the nature and extent of the central nervous system vascular malformation, given the constellation of symptoms and the diagnostic contextual factors.",
  "Central nervous system vascular malformations_2": "    Patient B, a 30-year-old individual, seeks medical evaluation for a concerning set of symptoms. They have been experiencing intermittent, moderate to severe headaches, with a self-reported pain level of 6/10. These headaches are often accompanied by episodes of visual disturbances. During these episodes, the patient describes seeing \"flashing lights\" and experiencing partial vision loss. Furthermore, they have reported instances of imbalance and dizziness, suggestive of neurological deficits affecting their balance and vision. Notably, there is no documented history of similar symptoms in the patient's family. However, the presence of visual disturbances and neurological deficits warrants a comprehensive diagnostic assessment to elucidate the underlying etiology, considering the possibility of central nervous system vascular malformations.",
  "Central nervous system vascular malformations_3": "    Patient C, a 50-year-old individual, presents with a complex medical history and a concerning symptom profile. They describe recurrent episodes of sudden and severe headaches, which they rate at 9/10 in intensity. These headaches are often accompanied by episodes of visual disturbances and transient speech difficulties. The patient has also reported instances of memory loss during these episodes. Additionally, they have a documented history of seizures, further complicating their clinical presentation. Notably, there is a family history of epilepsy. The combination of severe headaches, seizures, and various neurological deficits, along with the family history, necessitates a thorough diagnostic workup to investigate the presence of central nervous system vascular malformations and their potential contribution to the patient's symptoms."
