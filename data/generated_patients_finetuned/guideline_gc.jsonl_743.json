  "Pancreatic Cysts_1": "  Patient A, a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol consumption, presented with recurrent episodes of severe, epigastric abdominal pain (7/10 on the pain scale) radiating to the back, accompanied by jaundice. The pain episodes are often exacerbated after heavy meals. Laboratory investigations revealed significantly elevated serum CA 19-9 levels. Imaging studies demonstrated dilation of the main pancreatic duct (>5 mm) and focal dilation concerning for a main duct IPMN or an obstructing lesion. The patient's history of alcohol abuse further complicates the clinical presentation. Cyst fluid analysis, cyst fluid cytology, and molecular marker studies are essential for diagnostic evaluation, given the presence of concerning features.",
  "Pancreatic Cysts_2": "  Patient B, a 70-year-old female, with a known history of recurrent acute pancreatitis, presented with persistent abdominal discomfort and jaundice. The abdominal pain was described as moderate in intensity (5/10) and was frequently associated with nausea. Imaging studies revealed a large mucin-producing cyst measuring >3 cm in diameter. The patient's recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis and the development of jaundice raise concerns about the underlying etiology. Diagnostic evaluation, including cyst fluid analysis and molecular marker studies, is crucial to characterize the pancreatic cyst and guide further management.",
  "Pancreatic Cysts_3": "  Patient C, a 64-year-old male, without significant prior medical history, reported chronic, mild epigastric discomfort. He described the pain as a dull ache with an intensity of 3/10, often occurring postprandially. Additionally, he noticed a progressive yellowing of his eyes. Laboratory tests showed a marked elevation in serum CA 19-9 levels. Radiological imaging revealed a focal dilation of the pancreatic duct concerning for a mucin-producing cyst. The presence of jaundice and significantly elevated serum CA 19-9 levels necessitates thorough diagnostic workup, including cyst fluid analysis and molecular marker studies, to assess the nature of the cyst and its potential impact on the patient's clinical condition."
