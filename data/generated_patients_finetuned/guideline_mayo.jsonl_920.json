  "Shellfish Allergy_2": " Description 2:\nI evaluated a 32-year-old female patient who reported a history of allergic reactions immediately after consuming shellfish. The patient's symptoms included hives, an intensely itchy and irritated skin, as well as nasal stuffiness (congestion). She described episodes of swelling in the lips, face, and throat, which was accompanied by a sensation of tightness in the throat and coughing. The presence of these symptoms, along with the patient's history of shellfish-induced allergic reactions, strongly suggests a shellfish allergy. ",
