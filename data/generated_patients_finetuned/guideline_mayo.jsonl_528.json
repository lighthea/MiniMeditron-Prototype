  "Idiopathic hypersomnia_1": "Patient A, a 28-year-old office worker, presents with a complex constellation of symptoms. She reports a profound and persistent excessive daytime sleepiness, which she rates as 8/10 in severity, significantly impairing her daily functioning. Despite obtaining what she perceives as an adequate 7-9 hours of nocturnal sleep, Patient A experiences marked difficulty waking up in the morning, often requiring multiple alarms and intervention from family members. Furthermore, she describes a frequent sense of confusion and disorientation upon awakening from naps, which occurs almost daily. Notably, there is no history of substance abuse, and her family history is unremarkable for sleep disorders. She has not been using any medications that could account for her symptoms. These findings underscore the need for a comprehensive evaluation to elucidate the underlying etiology of her debilitating hypersomnolence.",
  "Idiopathic hypersomnia_2": "Patient B, a 35-year-old male, seeks medical attention for a perplexing set of symptoms. He reports overwhelming daytime sleepiness, which he rates as 9/10 in intensity, severely impacting his professional and social life. Despite consistently sleeping for 8-10 hours at night, Patient B experiences extreme difficulty waking up in the morning, often requiring the assistance of multiple alarm clocks. Moreover, he frequently feels confused and disoriented upon awakening from his daily naps. Importantly, there is no significant personal or family medical history that could explain his symptoms, and he is not using any medications known to induce hypersomnolence. These symptoms have persisted for over a year, prompting him to seek medical evaluation to determine the underlying cause of his profound hypersomnia.",
  "Idiopathic hypersomnia_3": "Patient C, a 30-year-old individual, presents with a challenging clinical picture characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness. The severity of this symptom, which the patient rates at 7/10, has led to recurrent difficulties in staying awake during work hours and engaging in social activities. Despite obtaining 7-8 hours of sleep each night, Patient C consistently struggles to wake up in the morning, often feeling groggy and disoriented. This difficulty is further compounded by a frequent sense of confusion and disorientation upon awakening from naps. Notably, there is no pertinent personal or family medical history that could account for these symptoms, and the patient is not using any medications known to cause hypersomnolence. Given the persistence and impact of these manifestations, a comprehensive diagnostic assessment is warranted to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of the patient's idiopathic hypersomnia."
