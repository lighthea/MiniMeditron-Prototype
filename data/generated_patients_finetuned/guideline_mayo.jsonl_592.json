  "Lichen planus_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 42-year-old woman with no significant medical history presented with a bothersome dermatological issue. She reported the sudden onset of a purple, shiny, flat rash on her inner forearms, accompanied by intense itchiness, which she rated as 7/10 in terms of discomfort. The rash appears to form distinct lines in areas where the patient has scratched her skin. Additionally, she has noticed lacy white patches on her tongue and the inside of her cheeks, contributing to mild oral discomfort. There is no history of contact with poison ivy. Given the presence of these cutaneous and oral symptoms, further evaluation is warranted to determine the underlying etiology.",
  "Lichen planus_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 35-year-old male patient, known to have a history of lichen planus affecting the oral mucosa, presented with a recurrent oral lesion. He described a painful sore in his mouth, localized to the inner cheek, with a discomfort level of 6/10. The lesion has been causing difficulty in eating and speaking. On examination, lacy white patches were observed in the vicinity of the painful sore. The patient reported no recent changes in his oral hygiene or dietary habits. Given his prior history and the persistence of these symptoms, an assessment is necessary to evaluate the extent of the condition and explore treatment options.",
  "Lichen planus_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 50-year-old woman with a known diagnosis of lichen planus, primarily affecting her nails and scalp, presented for a follow-up visit. She reported ongoing issues with her nails, including nail scarring and occasional dark lines extending from the tips to the base of her nails. The patient noted intermittent tenderness around the affected nails, rated at 4/10 for pain. Despite previous treatments, including topical and systemic therapies, the nail changes and discomfort persist. The scalp involvement has resulted in localized hair loss, which has been stable. Given the chronic nature of her condition and the limited response to prior interventions, a comprehensive re-evaluation is imperative to guide further management."
