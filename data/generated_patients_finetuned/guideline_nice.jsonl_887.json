  "Pancreatic necrosis_1": "**Patient Description 1:**\nA 52-year-old male with a complex medical history, including prolonged alcohol abuse, presented with a protracted hospital stay due to a previously undiagnosed condition. The patient has been receiving intensive care for the management of severe abdominal pain, which he described as constant, sharp, and radiating to his back, with a pain level consistently reported at 8/10. He has been experiencing persistent nausea and recurrent vomiting. Additionally, the patient developed a fever and was found to have leucocytosis on laboratory tests. The clinical context, including the extended hospitalization and the need for intensive care, raises concerns about the presence of pseudocysts and the possibility of an infection of necrotic tissue, further complicating the diagnostic process. Given the significant morbidity and high mortality associated with the condition, urgent and comprehensive evaluation is essential.",
  "Pancreatic necrosis_2": "**Patient Description 2:**\nA 65-year-old female patient, with a history of diabetes and recent hospitalization following an acute abdominal illness, is being evaluated for a complex constellation of symptoms. The patient's abdominal pain, rated at 7/10 in intensity, has been persistent and accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and a documented fever. Laboratory findings revealed leucocytosis, raising concerns about a potential infectious process. The presence of necrotic tissue and the context of the patient's recent hospital stay further complicate the diagnostic assessment. Given the elevated risk in this patient population, early recognition and intervention are crucial in light of the condition's significant morbidity and high mortality.",
  "Pancreatic necrosis_3": "**Patient Description 3:**\nA 45-year-old male patient, without significant past medical history, was admitted to the hospital with a prolonged and severe illness marked by abdominal pain, which he described as excruciating, with a pain score consistently at 9/10. The pain radiated to his back and was associated with persistent nausea and vomiting. The patient developed a fever, and laboratory tests indicated leucocytosis. These findings, coupled with the extended duration of the hospital stay and the need for intensive care, raise concerns about a potentially serious underlying condition. The presence of pseudocysts and the risk of infection in necrotic tissue further complicate the diagnostic process. Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with the condition, urgent and comprehensive evaluation is imperative for this patient."
