  "Hidradenitis suppurativa (acne inversa)_1": "Description 1:\nA 35-year-old female patient, with a history of excess weight and a current smoker, presented with a distressing dermatological issue. She has been experiencing blackheads in small, pitted areas of her skin, accompanied by painful, pea-sized lumps in the axillary and inguinal regions where the skin rubs together. The patient reported the presence of leaking bumps and sores that break open and drain pus, often emitting a foul odor. Additionally, she described the formation of tunnels under the skin connecting these lumps. The pain associated with these symptoms was rated as 7/10, significantly impacting her daily activities and causing limited, painful movement. Despite prior treatments, including topical agents and oral antibiotics, the patient has not experienced sustained improvement. Given the nature of her symptoms, the diagnostic process is further complicated by the frequent flares and the appearance of lesions in multiple locations.",
  "Hidradenitis suppurativa (acne inversa)_2": "Description 2:\nA 40-year-old male patient presented with a chronic dermatological condition that has profoundly affected his quality of life. He reported the presence of blackheads and painful, pea-sized lumps in the skin folds of the axillae and groin, where skin friction occurs. These lumps often develop into leaking bumps and sores, which drain pus and are associated with an unpleasant odor. The patient also noted the formation of tunnels under the skin, connecting the affected areas. He described his pain as persistent, with a severity rating of 6/10, leading to both limited movement and psychological distress. Importantly, the patient's medical history is notable for recurrent episodes of similar symptoms, with no lasting improvement despite various treatments. The diagnostic process is further influenced by the observed relationship between his excess weight and the worsening of his condition.",
  "Hidradenitis suppurativa (acne inversa)_3": "Description 3:\nA 30-year-old female patient, who is a nonsmoker and within a healthy weight range, presented with a challenging dermatological issue. She described the presence of blackheads in small, pitted areas of her skin, along with painful, pea-sized lumps in the axillary and inguinal regions, where skin friction occurs. These lumps frequently turned into leaking bumps and sores, which emitted a foul-smelling pus. The patient also reported the formation of tunnels under the skin, connecting these lumps. Her pain was rated at 5/10, leading to some degree of limited movement and psychological distress. Despite prior treatments with topical agents and oral antibiotics, the patient has not experienced sustained improvement. The diagnostic process is complex due to the frequent flares of her symptoms, as well as the mild nature of the condition in some individuals."
