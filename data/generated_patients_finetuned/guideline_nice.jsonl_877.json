  "Sciatica_1": "    Patient A, a 45-year-old male, presents with a chronic, debilitating pain radiating from the lower back to the left leg, which he describes as a sharp, shooting sensation, rated 8/10 on the pain scale, significantly impairing his mobility and quality of life. He reports accompanying numbness and weakness in the affected leg, particularly when attempting to stand from a seated position. Notably, he has experienced episodes of a painful foot drop, further hampering his ambulation. Despite prior conservative interventions, including physical therapy and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the symptoms persist. The diagnostic process is influenced by the pronounced severity of nerve compression, the patient's unresponsiveness to conservative treatments, and the specific location and size of the involved intervertebral disc.",
  "Sciatica_2": "    Patient B, a 35-year-old female, presents with a complex constellation of symptoms. She reports a two-month history of progressively worsening low back pain, radiating down her right leg, with a notable sensation of numbness and weakness in the affected limb. The pain, rated at 7/10, is exacerbated during prolonged sitting or forward bending. Additionally, she has started experiencing episodes of bladder dysfunction, including urinary retention and occasional loss of sensation in the perineal area. The diagnostic assessment is challenged by the evolving nature of her symptoms, the presence of bladder dysfunction, and the need to evaluate the severity of nerve compression and any responsiveness to prior conservative treatments.",
  "Sciatica_3": "    Patient C, a 50-year-old male with a history of intermittent low back pain, presents with an acute exacerbation of symptoms. He describes a shooting pain radiating from his back to his left leg, which he characterizes as 9/10 in intensity, severely restricting his ability to walk or stand for extended periods. The pain is accompanied by a pronounced numbness and weakness in the left leg, making it difficult for him to lift his foot and toes. Moreover, he reports a recent onset of bladder dysfunction, including urinary incontinence. Despite a history of occasional back pain, the sudden escalation of symptoms and the development of cauda equina syndrome necessitate a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to assess the location and size of the involved disc, the degree of nerve compression, and the urgency of intervention."
