  "Osteoarthritis_1": "    Patient A, a 62-year-old retired construction worker, presents with a complex clinical picture. He reports persistent joint stiffness in his knees and hips, rating his pain levels at 7/10, which is not adequately controlled by over-the-counter analgesics. These symptoms have substantially reduced his functional capacity, particularly in walking and climbing stairs. Importantly, the patient has a notable history of occupational joint stress and repetitive injury due to his previous job. Physical examination reveals crepitus in the affected joints, and imaging studies show characteristic joint changes. The presentation is indicative of a severe form of osteoarthritis, with a primary etiology aggravated by occupational factors.",
  "Osteoarthritis_2": "    Patient B, a 55-year-old individual with a history of autoimmune inflammatory conditions, consults with chronic joint issues. She describes a persistent, aching pain in multiple joints, particularly in the hands, knees, and spine, with a variable intensity ranging from 4 to 6/10. The pain is associated with significant joint stiffness, notably in the morning and following periods of inactivity. These symptoms have led to a reduced functional capacity, causing difficulties in daily activities such as buttoning clothes and gripping objects. The patient's medical history is pertinent for autoimmune diseases. Physical examination and imaging studies demonstrate characteristic joint findings consistent with osteoarthritis. Given the underlying autoimmune condition, the clinical presentation aligns with a secondary osteoarthritis pattern.",
  "Osteoarthritis_3": "    Patient C, a 68-year-old retired school teacher, seeks medical evaluation for joint-related issues. He reports chronic, dull pain in his hips and knees, with a pain intensity of 5/10, which has not responded significantly to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Joint stiffness, especially after prolonged sitting or in the morning, is a prominent feature. The pain and stiffness have contributed to a reduced capacity to walk long distances, impacting the patient's ability to engage in leisurely activities. Notably, there is no history of significant joint trauma or inflammatory conditions. Physical examination and imaging studies reveal characteristic joint changes consistent with osteoarthritis. The clinical presentation suggests a primary osteoarthritis pattern, with pain and stiffness being the predominant manifestations."
