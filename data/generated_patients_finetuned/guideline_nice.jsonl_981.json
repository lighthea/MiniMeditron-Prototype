  "Low back pain and sciatica_1": "    Description 1:\n    A 45-year-old male patient, with a history of occupations involving heavy lifting, presented with persistent low back pain that has lasted for over six months. The pain, rated at 7/10 on the visual analog scale (VAS), is localized in the lumbosacral region and radiates into the right leg, following a trajectory consistent with sciatica. The patient described the leg pain as sharp and shooting, accompanied by intermittent numbness and weakness in the same leg. His symptoms have been unresponsive to conservative treatments such as physical therapy and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Physical examination reveals reduced muscle strength and sensation in the affected leg, further indicating the severity of nerve compression. Given the prolonged duration, high pain intensity, and inadequate response to conservative measures, a comprehensive diagnostic workup is warranted to determine the underlying cause of this debilitating low back pain and sciatica.",
  "Low back pain and sciatica_2": "    Description 2:\n    A 55-year-old female patient, with a sedentary lifestyle, presented with a three-month history of low back pain, rated at 6/10 on the VAS, and a persistent, dull ache in her left leg. The leg pain, characteristic of sciatica, has been radiating from the buttock down to the posterior aspect of the thigh and calf. The patient reported occasional numbness and tingling sensations in the same leg, without significant muscle weakness. Although she had attempted some at-home remedies and light exercises, there was no substantial improvement in her symptoms. Physical examination revealed mild sensory deficits in the left leg. The patient's occupation and daily activities do not involve heavy lifting or strenuous movements. The duration and nature of her symptoms, along with the modest responsiveness to conservative measures, necessitate a thorough diagnostic evaluation to discern the etiology of her low back pain and sciatica.",
  "Low back pain and sciatica_3": "    Description 3:\n    A 35-year-old male patient, with a history of regular heavy weightlifting as part of his occupation, presented with acute low back pain that began a week ago. The pain, rated at 9/10 on the VAS, is localized in the lumbar region and extends into the right leg, following a typical sciatic distribution. The patient described the leg pain as excruciating, sharp, and burning, accompanied by marked numbness and weakness in the right leg. These symptoms have severely limited his mobility and ability to perform work-related tasks. Despite a short trial of over-the-counter pain medications, the patient's condition did not improve. Physical examination revealed profound muscle weakness and decreased sensation in the affected leg, indicating a severe nerve compression. Given the acute onset, high pain intensity, and the nature of the patient's strenuous activities, urgent diagnostic interventions are necessary to elucidate the underlying cause of his debilitating low back pain and sciatica."
