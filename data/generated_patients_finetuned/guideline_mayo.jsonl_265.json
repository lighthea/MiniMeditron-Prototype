  "Costochondritis_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 42-year-old female patient, with a history of regular high-impact aerobic exercise, presented with a persistent, sharp, and aching pain localized to the left side of her breastbone. The pain, rated at 6/10 in intensity, has been ongoing for the past four weeks and is exacerbated by deep breaths, strenuous upper body movements, as well as coughing. She also reports a noticeable tenderness over the affected area. The pain further radiates into her left arm and shoulder. Despite trying over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications, the symptoms have shown no significant improvement. Physical examination reveals tenderness along the left costal cartilages. Given the patient's physical activities and the characteristic nature of her pain, costochondritis is strongly considered, and diagnostic assessments are planned to confirm the condition and explore appropriate management.",
  "Costochondritis_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 30-year-old male patient, with a sedentary desk-job lifestyle, presented with a recurring, pressure-like pain that he described as 5/10 in intensity, located in the central chest area. The pain has been persistent for the last two months, with exacerbations during coughing, sneezing, and movements involving the chest wall. The patient noted that the pain also extends to multiple ribs and radiates into both arms and shoulders. No alleviation was achieved with over-the-counter analgesics. Physical examination reveals tenderness over the affected costal cartilages. Given the patient's occupation and the nature of his symptoms, costochondritis is a primary consideration. Further diagnostic tests are planned to confirm the diagnosis and determine an appropriate treatment plan.",
  "Costochondritis_3": "    Patient Description 3:\n    An 55-year-old patient, with a history of occasional heavy lifting at work, presented with a sharp, aching pain on the right side of the breastbone, rated at 7/10 in intensity. The pain has been bothering the patient for six weeks and is exacerbated by deep breaths, chest wall movements, and heavy lifting activities. The pain also radiates into the right arm and shoulder. Despite trying various home remedies, there has been no significant relief. Physical examination reveals tenderness and mild swelling along the right costal cartilages. Given the patient's history of heavy lifting and the characteristic pain presentation, costochondritis is highly suspected. Diagnostic assessments are planned to confirm the diagnosis and establish an appropriate management strategy, taking into account the patient's occupational activities."
