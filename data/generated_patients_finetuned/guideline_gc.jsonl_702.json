  "Cystic Pancreatic Neoplasms_1": "Description 1:\nA 55-year-old female patient, with a history of chronic pancreatitis, presented with recurrent upper abdominal pain rated at 6/10 on the pain scale. The pain is often localized to the epigastric region and radiates to her back. She reported experiencing multiple episodes of unexplained weight loss over the past six months. Abdominal imaging revealed a cystic lesion in the pancreas, along with a suspicious mass lesion and an epithelial nodule. The main pancreatic duct appeared dilated. Given the size of the cystic lesion, the presence of a mass, epithelial nodule, and a dilated main pancreatic duct, further diagnostic workup is warranted to evaluate the nature of this neoplastic lesion.",
  "Cystic Pancreatic Neoplasms_2": "Description 2:\nA 45-year-old male patient, without significant medical history, presented with a three-month history of intermittent, dull upper abdominal pain. He rated the pain at 4/10 and described it as localized to the epigastric area. The pain was not associated with any specific triggers. The patient had noticed a gradual, unexplained weight loss during this period. Abdominal imaging revealed a cystic lesion in the pancreas, a suspicious mass lesion, and an associated dilated main pancreatic duct. These findings, along with the patient's symptoms, necessitate further evaluation to determine the nature of this cystic pancreatic neoplasm.",
  "Cystic Pancreatic Neoplasms_3": "Description 3:\nA 60-year-old male patient, with a family history of pancreatic disorders, presented with recurrent, sharp upper abdominal pain. He rated the pain at 7/10, often describing it as piercing and localized to the epigastric region. The pain episodes were frequent and sometimes accompanied by nausea. The patient also reported an unintended weight loss of 10 pounds over the last four months. Abdominal imaging revealed a sizable cystic lesion in the pancreas, along with a suspicious mass lesion, an epithelial nodule, and a dilated main pancreatic duct. Given the family history, the presence of these specific symptoms, and the imaging findings, a comprehensive diagnostic assessment is necessary to characterize the cystic pancreatic neoplasm and guide appropriate management."
