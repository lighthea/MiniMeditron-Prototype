  "Polycystic ovary syndrome_1": " 1. A 28-year-old woman, with a history of irregular menstrual cycles and obesity, presented with a constellation of symptoms. She reported persistent hirsutism with a Ferriman-Gallwey score of 12, severe acne resistant to over-the-counter treatments, and male-pattern baldness. The patient experienced intermittent, long-lasting periods and had difficulty conceiving for the past 18 months. Physical examination revealed enlarged ovaries on ultrasound, along with the presence of small fluid-filled cysts on the outer edge. Given her clinical presentation, the diagnostic evaluation is further complicated by the coexisting obesity and insulin resistance, which may confound the interpretation of androgen levels. A comprehensive assessment is warranted to address her fertility concerns and manage her complex hormonal manifestations.",
  "Polycystic ovary syndrome_2": "2. A 30-year-old woman, with a family history of polycystic ovary syndrome, was referred to the endocrinology clinic for evaluation. She reported a history of few and irregular menstrual periods since menarche, often lasting more than ten days. The patient also described the gradual onset of excess facial and body hair, causing significant distress. Despite various attempts, her severe acne had been refractory to multiple topical and systemic treatments. Physical examination revealed male-pattern baldness and bilaterally enlarged ovaries. Pelvic ultrasound confirmed the presence of multiple small cysts on the outer edge of the ovaries. The patient's hereditary predisposition, along with the documented symptoms, underscores the importance of an accurate diagnostic approach, considering the impact of heredity on the condition.",
  "Polycystic ovary syndrome_3": "3. A 25-year-old woman presented with a history of prolonged and irregular menstrual cycles, which had been a recurring issue since menarche. She reported excess facial and body hair, along with male-pattern baldness, indicative of hirsutism. The patient's menstrual irregularity was further compounded by episodes of long-lasting periods. Despite her desire to conceive, she expressed difficulty getting pregnant for over a year. On pelvic ultrasound, her ovaries appeared larger than normal, and multiple small fluid-filled cysts were observed on the outer edge. Notably, the presence of excess androgens was documented in her medical history. The diagnostic assessment should consider these factors, as well as the impact of androgen excess on her clinical presentation and fertility concerns."
