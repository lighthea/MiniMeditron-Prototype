  "Atrial Fibrillation_1": "   Case 1:\nA 58-year-old male patient, with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), presented with persistently symptomatic AF episodes despite a trial of class I/III antiarrhythmic drugs. The patient described his symptoms as palpitations, which he rated as 7/10 in severity, accompanied by significant fatigue. Notably, echocardiography revealed left atrial enlargement (4.8 cm), and the patient had more than moderate mitral regurgitation. The symptomatic AF, in the presence of left atrial enlargement and significant mitral regurgitation, underscores the complexity of managing this patient's condition.",
  "Atrial Fibrillation_2": "   Case 2:\nA 64-year-old female patient with a history of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) presented with ongoing symptomatic AF, despite treatment with class I/III antiarrhythmic drugs. She described her symptoms as palpitations, rated at 8/10 in severity, along with dyspnea on exertion. Echocardiography revealed left atrial enlargement (5.2 cm) in the absence of structural heart disease. The patient's symptomatic persistent AF, coupled with significant left atrial enlargement, poses challenges in therapeutic management.",
  "Atrial Fibrillation_3": "   Case 3:\nA 70-year-old male patient, known for longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation (AF), reported persistent symptoms of palpitations and chest discomfort despite prior treatment with catheter-based therapy. He rated his palpitations as 6/10 in severity and described his chest discomfort as intermittent, with a severity of 5/10. Echocardiography showed left atrial enlargement (4.7 cm) in the absence of structural heart disease. The patient's refractory symptomatic AF, in the setting of left atrial enlargement, necessitates a comprehensive reevaluation of his treatment strategy."
