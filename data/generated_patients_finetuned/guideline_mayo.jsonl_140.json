  "Brachial plexus injury_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 32-year-old active individual, with a history of regular participation in contact sports, presented with a complex set of symptoms. The patient reported recurrent episodes of a sharp, electric shock-like sensation radiating down the right arm, often accompanied by a burning pain (rated 7/10 on the pain scale). These episodes, described as \"burners and stingers,\" have been occurring for the past six months, coinciding with the onset of numbness and weakness in the affected arm. Furthermore, the patient experiences weakness in the right hand and arm, which has led to a noticeable decline in grip strength. Physical examination revealed a reduced range of motion in the shoulder, along with muscle atrophy. The presence of neck pain, although intermittent, was also reported. Given the nature and severity of the symptoms, as well as the patient's history of sports-related activities, a comprehensive assessment is warranted to determine the underlying cause and extent of the brachial plexus injury.",
  "Brachial plexus injury_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 45-year-old patient, with a history of occupational exposure to repetitive overhead work, presented with a concerning constellation of symptoms. The individual reported a persistent, severe, burning sensation (rated 8/10 in intensity) that travels down the left arm, often resembling an electric shock. This sensation is accompanied by recurrent episodes of \"burners and stingers.\" The patient has also noticed a progressive numbness and weakness in the left arm, particularly affecting certain muscles in the hand and shoulder. Despite previous conservative measures such as rest and ergonomic modifications at work, there has been no significant improvement. The associated weakness in the affected limb has led to limitations in performing occupational tasks. Additionally, the patient described intermittent neck pain. Given the chronic nature of the symptoms, their impact on occupational function, and the history of repetitive overhead work, a thorough evaluation is essential to assess the extent and nature of the brachial plexus injury.",
  "Brachial plexus injury_3": "    Patient Description 3:\n    A 50-year-old individual presented with a bilateral upper extremity problem. The patient described a long-standing history of recurrent, electric shock-like sensations, often characterized as \"burners and stingers,\" affecting both arms. These episodes are associated with a constant, severe burning pain (rated 9/10 in intensity) that radiates down the arms, accompanied by numbness and weakness. The patient has observed a decline in muscle strength in both hands and arms, along with a persistent sensation of weakness. These symptoms have persisted for over a year and have significantly impacted the individual's ability to perform daily activities, including lifting objects and engaging in household chores. Additionally, there is a history of intermittent neck pain. The bilateral nature, chronicity, and profound functional impact of the symptoms necessitate a comprehensive diagnostic assessment to elucidate the underlying brachial plexus injury and its extent."
