  "Astigmatism_1": "    Patient A, a 25-year-old graphic designer, presents with a chief complaint of persistent blurred vision and eyestrain, particularly during prolonged screen work. The symptoms have been gradually worsening over the past year and are often accompanied by headaches, rated at 6/10 on the pain scale. Despite utilizing computer glasses, the visual discomfort persists. Additionally, Patient A reports difficulty with night vision and occasional squinting when focusing on distant objects. Notably, there is no significant ocular or medical history. The diagnostic evaluation in this case should encompass a comprehensive vision assessment, including a detailed refraction test, to elucidate the etiology of the visual disturbances and guide appropriate management.",
  "Astigmatism_2": "    Patient B, a 36-year-old office worker, seeks medical evaluation for recurrent headaches and eyestrain. She describes her blurred vision as a persistent issue, especially when reading or using electronic devices, with accompanying discomfort in the eyes. The headaches, rated at 5/10 in intensity, are often localized around the brow and temple regions. Despite adjusting her workstation ergonomics and taking frequent breaks, the visual symptoms persist. Patient B has also noticed difficulty with night vision and occasionally finds herself squinting to improve focus. Her past medical history is unremarkable. Given these symptoms, a comprehensive ophthalmic assessment, including a detailed refraction test, is essential to determine the underlying cause and formulate an effective treatment plan.",
  "Astigmatism_3": "    Patient C, a 7-year-old child, is brought in by their parent, who is concerned about the child's vision. Although the child has not reported any visual issues, the parent has observed frequent squinting, especially during activities such as reading and watching television. The child experiences occasional headaches, which are described as dull and transient (3/10 in intensity). As per the provided contextual information, it is crucial to screen children for potential eye diseases and vision problems.
