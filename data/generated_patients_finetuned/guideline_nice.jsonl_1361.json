  "Hallux Valgus_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 58-year-old female patient with a notable history of high-heeled shoe use presented with a chief complaint of persistent pain in her right foot. She described the pain as throbbing and rated it 6/10 in intensity, localized over the medial aspect of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. On examination, there is a visible deviation of her right big toe towards the neighboring toes, accompanied by the formation of a bony protrusion, which she finds cosmetically concerning. The patient also reported difficulty with footwear due to the bunion. Radiographic assessment and a survey on patient satisfaction would be essential for further diagnostic and treatment planning.",
  "Hallux Valgus_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 45-year-old male patient, who is an avid runner, presented with a persistent and sharp pain (rated 7/10) in his left foot. He reported difficulty finding comfortable footwear and noted a visible deviation of his left big toe, which has been progressively worsening over the last year. On examination, there is a bony protrusion and skin damage over the medial aspect of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. The patient's active lifestyle and the impact of the condition on his ability to run make the diagnostic and treatment process crucial. Radiographic correction of the deformity and pedobarography for foot pressure measurement would be essential in this case.",
  "Hallux Valgus_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 63-year-old male patient, with a family history of foot problems, presented with chronic pain (rated 5/10) in both of his feet. He described the pain as aching and localized over the first metatarsophalangeal joints. The patient reported significant difficulty with footwear, especially closed shoes, due to the deviation of both big toes towards the other toes. On examination, bony protrusions and skin damage over the affected joints were observed. Given the bilateral nature of the condition and the patient's family history, X-ray monitoring and a comprehensive assessment of the timing of events are necessary to determine the most effective course of action for diagnostic and potential treatment modalities."
