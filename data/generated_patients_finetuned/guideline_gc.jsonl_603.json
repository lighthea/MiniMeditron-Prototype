  "Oligometastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer_1": "Description 1:\nA 57-year-old patient, a former heavy smoker, presented with persistent cough, shortness of breath, and occasional chest pain (rated 4/10) that has been ongoing for the past 3 months. The chest pain is exacerbated during deep inspirations and is not alleviated by over-the-counter analgesics. Physical examination revealed decreased breath sounds in the right lower lung. Imaging studies confirmed the presence of up to 5 distant metastases in the lungs and bones. Given the patient's smoking history and the observed symptoms, further diagnostic evaluation is crucial to determine the extent and nature of the oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer.",
  "Oligometastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer_2": "Description 2:\nA 64-year-old patient with a history of non-small cell lung cancer, who underwent surgical resection two years ago, presented with recurrent symptoms. The patient reported a persistent, dry cough and mild chest discomfort (rated 3/10) localized to the site of the previous surgical resection. Physical examination revealed decreased breath sounds in the right upper lung. Imaging studies confirmed the presence of a single oligorecurrent lesion in the lung parenchyma. The patient's symptoms, along with the history of NSCLC and the identification of a solitary recurrent lesion, point to a metachronous oligorecurrent NSCLC. Further assessment is necessary to determine the appropriate management strategy.",
  "Oligometastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer_3": "Description 3:\nA 49-year-old patient with a known diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer, receiving systemic therapy, reported worsening respiratory symptoms. The patient described increased cough, persistent chest pain (rated 6/10), and dyspnea on exertion. The chest pain is described as pleuritic and is not adequately controlled with the current analgesic regimen. On examination, there were localized chest wall tenderness over the site of the primary tumor. Imaging studies revealed progression in a previously treated oligometastatic lesion. The presence of induced oligoprogressive NSCLC, along with the worsening symptoms and imaging findings, necessitates a comprehensive reassessment of the treatment approach."
