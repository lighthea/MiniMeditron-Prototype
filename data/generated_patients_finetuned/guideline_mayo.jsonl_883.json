  "Rotavirus infection_1": "Doctor's Description 1:\nA 2-year-old patient, with no history of intussusception, was brought in by the parents presenting with a fever of 101\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C) and recurrent vomiting. The vomiting episodes have been frequent, occurring approximately four to five times within the last 24 hours. Additionally, the patient has been experiencing watery diarrhea, with a frequency of six episodes per day. The parents noted mild to moderate abdominal pain, which seems to exacerbate during bowel movements. The patient's age aligns with the demographic commonly affected by rotavirus infection, and the absence of a history of intussusception further supports this assessment.",
  "Rotavirus infection_2": "Doctor's Description 2:\nA 4-year-old patient, without a history of intussusception, was seen in the clinic with a 2-day history of fever, peaking at 102.5\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), and persistent vomiting. The vomiting episodes have occurred approximately six times in the last 24 hours, leading to decreased oral intake. The patient is now manifesting watery diarrhea, with a frequency of seven episodes per day. The parents reported that the abdominal pain, rated as moderate, has been consistent and is a source of distress for the child. Given the age of the patient and the absence of a history of intussusception, the clinical presentation strongly suggests a possible rotavirus infection.",
  "Rotavirus infection_3": "Doctor's Description 3:\nAn adult patient, aged 30, with no history of intussusception, presented with a low-grade fever of 100.5\u00b0F (38.1\u00b0C) and a 2-day history of recurrent vomiting, occurring approximately four to five times within the last 24 hours. The vomiting episodes have been accompanied by watery diarrhea, with a frequency of five episodes per day. The patient complained of mild to moderate abdominal pain, which has persisted alongside the other symptoms. The absence of a history of intussusception, coupled with the age of the patient, raises suspicion of a potential rotavirus infection, despite it being less common in adults. "
