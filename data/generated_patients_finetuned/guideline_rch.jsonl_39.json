  "Hereditary Angioedema(HAE)_1": "Description 1:\nA 35-year-old female patient, with a family history of similar symptoms, presented with recurrent episodes of angioedema without pruritis and urticaria. The patient reported moderate abdominal pain, which she described as crampy and recurrent, often accompanied by nausea and occasional vomiting. Physical examination revealed laryngeal edema, leading to a hoarse voice and persistent cough. The patient also experienced dysphagia and noted swelling of her tongue. These symptoms have been impacting her quality of life, and she reported increased stress levels due to the unpredictability of the episodes. Given the recurrent nature of her symptoms and the family history, a comprehensive workup is essential to determine the underlying etiology and establish an appropriate management plan.",
  "Hereditary Angioedema(HAE)_2": "Description 2:\nA 28-year-old male patient presented with swelling of the extremities, along with episodes of mild to moderate abdominal pain, which he described as crampy. These abdominal symptoms were occasionally accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The patient also reported a persistent cough and hoarseness of voice, indicative of laryngeal edema. Notably, the episodes seemed to be exacerbated during periods of increased stress, which the patient attributed to his demanding work schedule. His medical history was significant for recent dental work. Given the recurrent nature of his symptoms and the temporal association with stress and dental procedures, a thorough evaluation is warranted to elucidate the underlying cause.",
  "Hereditary Angioedema(HAE)_3": "Description 3:\nA 22-year-old female patient presented with severe abdominal pain, rated at 8/10 in intensity, and recurrent episodes of vomiting. These episodes were associated with angioedema without pruritis and urticaria. Physical examination revealed laryngeal edema, causing stridor and respiratory distress. The patient reported a history of similar episodes during her menstrual cycles, further suggesting a potential hormonal influence. Her symptoms had a significant impact on her daily activities, and she expressed heightened anxiety, particularly during menstruation. A comprehensive assessment is crucial to diagnose the underlying condition and implement an effective treatment strategy, considering the impact of hormonal fluctuations on her presentation."
