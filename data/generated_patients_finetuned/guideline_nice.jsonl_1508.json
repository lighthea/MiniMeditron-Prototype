  "fetal pleural effusion_1": "\n    Description 1:\n    A preterm infant, born at 32 weeks gestation, is presenting with a large, persistent pleural effusion. The pleural effusion has led to pronounced respiratory compromise, with the patient exhibiting increased work of breathing and decreased oxygen saturation. Despite initial respiratory support, the infant's condition has not shown significant improvement. Given the preterm delivery and the presence of respiratory compromise, further diagnostic evaluation is crucial to determine the underlying etiology of the pleural effusion and to assess for potential pulmonary hypoplasia or hydrops fetalis.",
  "fetal pleural effusion_2": "    Description 2:\n    A term newborn is admitted with a notable pleural effusion, leading to respiratory compromise. The infant's respiratory distress is characterized by tachypnea, grunting, and chest wall retractions. The large and persistent nature of the pleural effusion has necessitated respiratory support, and the patient's pain score remains consistently high, despite attempts at analgesia and supportive care. The diagnostic approach should take into account the underlying etiology of the pleural effusion, as well as the potential impact of pulmonary hypoplasia or hydrops fetalis, given the severity of the presentation.",
  "fetal pleural effusion_3": "    Description 3:\n    A newborn infant with a history of prenatal complications is exhibiting a large, persistent pleural effusion, which is causing significant respiratory compromise. The infant's oxygen saturation levels are consistently low, and there is an increased need for respiratory support. The patient's medical history includes findings suggestive of fetal hydrops. Given these factors, the diagnostic workup should be comprehensive, taking into account the underlying etiology of the pleural effusion, the presence of hydrops fetalis, and the potential for associated pulmonary hypoplasia. The management plan should aim to address the respiratory compromise and the specific etiology contributing to the fetal pleural effusion."
