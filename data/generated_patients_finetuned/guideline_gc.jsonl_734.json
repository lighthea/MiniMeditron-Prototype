  "Thoracolumbar Spine Trauma_1": "\nPatient Description 1:\nA 45-year-old male, with a history of participating in high-impact sports, presented with excruciating thoracolumbar back pain (rated 8/10) following a fall. He also reported numbness and weakness in both of his lower limbs, which he described as a tingling sensation and difficulty in moving his legs. Clinical examination revealed neurological deficits, including decreased sensation in the sacral region, ankle spasticity, and impaired urethral and rectal sphincter function. Radiographic findings showed evidence of thoracic and lumbar fractures. The diagnostic process is crucial in determining the grade of American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale and guiding the timing and approach for potential surgical intervention.",
  "Thoracolumbar Spine Trauma_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 30-year-old female was brought to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident, resulting in thoracolumbar spine trauma. She complained of severe back pain (rated 9/10) that was worsened with any movement. Upon examination, she exhibited neurological deficits, including bilateral lower limb weakness and altered sensation. The patient's medical history indicated a prior spine surgery with the presence of arthrodesis. Radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed thoracic and lumbar fractures, further complicating the diagnostic process to determine the most suitable surgical approach and the need for thromboprophylaxis.",
  "Thoracolumbar Spine Trauma_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 60-year-old male, involved in a workplace injury, presented with persistent thoracolumbar back pain (rated 7/10) and neurological deficits in his lower extremities. The patient had a history of chronic back pain and had undergone multiple previous spinal procedures, including the use of open and percutaneous pedicle screws. Neurological assessment scales revealed a decline in lower limb motor function and sacral sensation. Radiographic findings indicated thoracic and lumbar fractures, adding complexity to the diagnostic process due to the patient's surgical history and the selection of appropriate interventions. Additionally, the presence of previous hardware and arthrodesis further influenced the evaluation and treatment planning."
