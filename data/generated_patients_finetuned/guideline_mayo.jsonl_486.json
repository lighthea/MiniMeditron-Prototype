  "Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 26-year-old female patient with a significant medical history characterized by frequent nosebleeds, often on a daily basis since childhood, presents with lacy red vessels and tiny red spots on her lips, face, fingertips, tongue, and inside the mouth. She has experienced episodes of iron deficiency anemia, for which she has been intermittently treated. The patient reports occasional headaches and a persistent sensation of shortness of breath. Given the early onset of nosebleeds and the presence of multiple characteristic skin and mucosal findings, the diagnostic process should consider hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT).",
  "Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 35-year-old male patient, with a history of recurrent nosebleeds dating back to his childhood, presents with a complex set of symptoms. He exhibits lacy red vessels and tiny red spots on his lips, face, fingertips, tongue, and inside his mouth. The patient has a documented medical history of iron deficiency anemia, which has required ongoing management. Additionally, he reports episodes of headaches and intermittent shortness of breath. Given the prolonged history of nosebleeds and the presence of characteristic skin and mucosal findings, along with systemic manifestations such as anemia and respiratory symptoms, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) should be a key consideration in the diagnostic evaluation.",
  "Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 16-year-old adolescent patient, with a notable medical background of frequent nosebleeds since early childhood, presents a unique diagnostic challenge. The patient exhibits lacy red vessels and tiny red spots on the lips, face, fingertips, tongue, and inside the mouth. There is a history of iron deficiency anemia, which has been managed over the years. The patient also reports intermittent headaches and episodes of shortness of breath. Given the early onset of nosebleeds and the presence of characteristic skin and mucosal findings, the diagnostic process should thoroughly evaluate the possibility of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), even though some symptoms may not yet be apparent in children or young adults."
