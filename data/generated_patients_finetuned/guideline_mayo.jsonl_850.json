  "Pyoderma gangrenosum_1": "    Case 1:\n    A 38-year-old female patient with a history of ulcerative colitis presented with a distressing dermatological issue. She described the sudden onset of a small, red bump on her lower leg, which rapidly transformed into a large, exquisitely painful open sore. The ulcer exhibited bluish, overhanging borders and was not associated with any known trauma. Upon examination, multiple ulcers in different stages of development were noted in the affected area. The patient reported high levels of pain (8/10) at the ulcer site, significantly impacting her daily activities. Given her underlying autoimmune condition, the observed skin lesions raise concerns regarding the possibility of an associated systemic manifestation.",
  "Pyoderma gangrenosum_2": "    Case 2:\n    A 50-year-old male patient, known for his diagnosis of Crohn's disease, presented with a challenging dermatological manifestation. He reported the appearance of a small, painful bump on his abdomen, which subsequently evolved into a large, rapidly growing open sore with a bluish, overhanging border. The ulcer was situated near a previous surgical site. Notably, the patient experienced a pain level of 7/10 at the lesion site, prompting his visit. On examination, the healthcare provider observed multiple ulcers in various stages of development around the abdominal area. The presence of these atypical ulcers, coupled with the patient's history of Crohn's disease, underscores the need for a comprehensive evaluation to elucidate the underlying etiology of his cutaneous condition.",
  "Pyoderma gangrenosum_3": "    Case 3:\n    In an unusual presentation, a 45-year-old female patient without a documented history of autoimmune diseases or skin trauma sought medical attention for a concerning skin issue. She described the spontaneous development of a painful, rapidly growing skin wound on her upper arm, which had a bluish, overhanging border. The patient rated her pain at the site as 9/10, significantly impacting her quality of life. Upon examination, a single, large ulcer that had grown rapidly was observed, exhibiting the characteristic features associated with pyoderma gangrenosum. The absence of known autoimmune conditions or recent skin trauma adds complexity to the diagnostic process, necessitating a thorough investigation to determine the underlying cause of this distressing dermatological presentation."
