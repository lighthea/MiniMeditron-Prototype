  "active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis in adults_1": "    Patient A, a 38-year-old male, presents with a complex medical history that includes a long-standing musculoskeletal discomfort. He reports a consistent, dull lumbar pain (VAS 4/10) that is not adequately controlled with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Physical examination reveals objective signs of inflammation, supported by elevated C-reactive protein levels. The patient has previously tried TNF-alpha inhibitors, which were found to be unsuitable and ineffective in managing his condition. Additionally, due to commercial arrangements, the availability of upadacitinib is a relevant factor in the treatment decision. It is important to note that Patient A has no known physical, sensory, or learning disabilities that could impact the diagnostic process.",
  "active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis in adults_2": "    Patient B, a 42-year-old female, presents with a history of chronic back pain and inflammatory symptoms. She describes her current spinal discomfort as a persistent, throbbing ache (VAS 6/10), which has not been well-managed with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Objective signs of inflammation are evident, supported by elevated C-reactive protein levels and characteristic MRI findings. The patient's medical history reveals prior use of TNF-alpha inhibitors, which were found to be ineffective in controlling her condition. The availability of upadacitinib according to commercial arrangement is a relevant factor in treatment options. Notably, Patient B has no physical, sensory, or learning disabilities that could impact the diagnostic process.",
  "active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis in adults_3": "    Patient C, a 45-year-old male, presents with a history of recurrent, unrelenting back pain. He describes his current discomfort as a constant, sharp pain in the lumbar region (VAS 8/10), which has been refractory to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Objective signs of inflammation, along with elevated C-reactive protein levels, are noted on examination. Despite prior treatment attempts, TNF-alpha inhibitors were found to be unsuitable or ineffective in controlling his condition. The availability of upadacitinib according to commercial arrangement is a relevant factor in treatment considerations. Furthermore, the patient has no physical, sensory, or learning disabilities that could impact the diagnostic process."
