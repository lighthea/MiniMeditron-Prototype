She describes the discomfort as persistent, with a notable increase in pain levels after prolonged periods of both sitting and standing. The patient's occupation requires her to alternate between desk work and prolonged standing, which significantly exacerbates her symptoms. Furthermore, she reports that climbing stairs and taking large steps when moving forward intensify her pain and stiffness. The patient has a history of fluctuating weight, with recurrent episodes of increased body mass. There is no record of prior treatments for her current condition. The constellation of symptoms, coupled with the patient's lifestyle and weight fluctuations, necessitates a comprehensive diagnostic assessment.",
