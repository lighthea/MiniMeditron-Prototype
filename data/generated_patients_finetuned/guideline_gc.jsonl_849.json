  "Resected Biliary Tract Cancer_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 65-year-old male, a former heavy smoker, presented with a 3-month history of recurrent episodes of jaundice, pruritus, and intermittent, dull right upper quadrant abdominal pain with a severity rating of 5/10. He had undergone a cholecystectomy four years ago. On examination, his skin and sclerae were notably icteric, and palpation of the abdomen revealed mild hepatomegaly. Laboratory tests showed elevated serum bilirubin levels and alkaline phosphatase. Imaging studies revealed biliary ductal dilation. The patient's history of smoking and the nature of his abdominal pain raise concerns about potential biliary tract pathology, necessitating further diagnostic evaluation.",
  "Resected Biliary Tract Cancer_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 50-year-old female with a history of choledochal cyst resection during childhood presented with a 2-month history of recurrent, colicky right upper quadrant abdominal pain, which she rated at 7/10 in intensity. The episodes of pain were often associated with nausea and vomiting. Physical examination was remarkable for mild jaundice and right upper quadrant tenderness. Laboratory investigations showed elevated liver enzyme levels, and imaging studies demonstrated biliary ductal dilatation. Given the patient's history of choledochal cyst resection and the character of her abdominal pain, there is a heightened suspicion of biliary tract-related issues, necessitating a comprehensive diagnostic workup.",
  "Resected Biliary Tract Cancer_3": "    Patient Description 3:\n    A 70-year-old male patient, with a history of liver resection for a benign lesion, presented with a 4-month history of progressive jaundice, dark urine, and generalized pruritus. He described his pruritus as constant and severe, with a rating of 8/10. There were no significant abdominal symptoms, and the patient's physical examination was unremarkable, except for marked jaundice. Laboratory tests revealed markedly elevated serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels. Imaging studies indicated biliary ductal dilatation. Given the patient's history of liver resection and the severity of his pruritus, a comprehensive evaluation of the biliary tract is imperative to determine the underlying etiology of his presenting symptoms."
