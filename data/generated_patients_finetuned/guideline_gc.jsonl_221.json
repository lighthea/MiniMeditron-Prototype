  "Colon Ischemia_1": "    **Patient Description 1:**\nA 55-year-old male patient, with a history of hypertension and smoking, presented with a sudden onset of cramping, mild abdominal pain localized in the lower abdomen (pain score 3/10), and an urgent desire to defecate. He has been experiencing episodes of bloody diarrhea, with the passage of bright red blood per rectum (hematochezia). The patient's CT findings reveal evidence of transmural colonic infarction, raising concerns about severe colon ischemia. Given the clinical picture and the presence of risk factors, further evaluation is crucial to determine the extent of ischemic damage and to guide appropriate management.",
  "Colon Ischemia_2": "    **Patient Description 2:**\nA 65-year-old female patient, known for her history of diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, presented to the emergency department with a sudden and severe abdominal pain localized in the left lower quadrant (pain score 8/10). She describes an urgent desire to defecate, accompanied by episodes of bloody diarrhea and hematochezia. The clinical presentation, along with the patient's medical history, raises a high index of suspicion for acute mesenteric ischemia as a heralding sign of colon ischemia. Immediate diagnostic workup is essential to assess the extent of ischemic damage and to rule out the presence of irreversible ischemic changes, such as gangrene.",
  "Colon Ischemia_3": "    **Patient Description 3:**\nA 70-year-old male patient, who has a history of atrial fibrillation and ischemic heart disease, was admitted with acute abdominal pain (pain score 6/10), predominantly in the lower abdomen. He has been experiencing recurrent episodes of bloody diarrhea, along with the passage of bright red blood per rectum (hematochezia). The presence of AMI as a comorbid condition complicates the diagnostic and management approach for colon ischemia. Immediate evaluation is necessary to delineate the severity of colon ischemia and to determine the presence of acute peritonitis, given the patient's high-risk profile."
