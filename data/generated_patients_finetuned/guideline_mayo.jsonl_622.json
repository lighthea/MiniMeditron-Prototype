  "Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS)_1": "    Patient A, a 35-year-old female, presents with a complex constellation of symptoms. She describes persistent upper middle stomach pain, which she rates as 7/10 on the pain scale, often alleviated when she leans forward. The pain frequently intensifies after eating, exercising, or changing body position, accompanied by bloating, diarrhea, nausea, and occasional episodes of vomiting. Notably, she reports a fear of eating due to the pain, leading to significant weight loss and a noticeable impact on her quality of life. Despite her distress, previous medical evaluations have yielded inconclusive results. Given the presence of nerve compression, celiac artery blood flow issues, and the patient's fear-related weight loss and resulting psychological impact, a comprehensive diagnostic approach is warranted to elucidate the underlying etiology of her debilitating symptoms.",
  "Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS)_2": "    Patient B, a 42-year-old male, seeks medical attention for recurrent, debilitating upper middle stomach pain. He describes the pain as sharp and persistent, with a severity rating of 8/10, often abating when he leans forward. Additionally, he experiences pronounced stomach discomfort after eating, exercising, or changing body position, frequently accompanied by bloating and episodes of diarrhea. These symptoms have led to a noticeable fear of eating, resulting in significant weight loss and an adverse impact on his mental well-being. Despite previous medical assessments, the patient's condition remains undetermined. Given the observed nerve compression, celiac artery blood flow issues, and the patient's fear-related weight loss and psychological distress, a comprehensive and focused diagnostic approach is essential to uncover the root cause of his distressing symptoms.",
  "Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS)_3": "    Patient C, a 28-year-old female, presents with a perplexing medical profile characterized by chronic upper middle stomach pain. She rates her pain as 6/10 in severity and notes that it often diminishes when she leans forward. The discomfort significantly worsens after meals, exercise, or changes in body position, and she frequently experiences bloating, diarrhea, nausea, and sporadic vomiting episodes. Importantly, the patient has developed a profound fear of eating due to the pain, resulting in substantial weight loss and a noticeable decline in her quality of life. Despite prior medical assessments, a definitive diagnosis has remained elusive. Given the presence of nerve compression, compromised celiac artery blood flow, and the patient's fear-induced weight loss and psychological impact, an in-depth and targeted diagnostic strategy is imperative to uncover the underlying cause of her distressing symptoms."
