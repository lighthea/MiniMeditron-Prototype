  "Dry socket (alveolar osteitis)_1": " Patient Description 1:\nA 42-year-old male patient, with a history of smoking, presented with a distressing problem following a recent tooth extraction. The patient reported severe, throbbing pain (rated 8/10) in the extraction site, which has been persistent for the past three days. On examination, there is a noticeable absence of blood clot, and the socket appears dry with visible bone. The pain radiates from the extraction site to his ear and temple on the same side of his face. Additionally, the patient has been experiencing bad breath and an unpleasant taste in his mouth. Given the clinical presentation and the patient's history, the diagnostic process will include X-rays to rule out other potential conditions.",
  "Dry socket (alveolar osteitis)_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 35-year-old female patient, who underwent a tooth extraction procedure five days ago, presented with a concerning oral condition. She described her pain at the extraction site as excruciating (rated 9/10) and radiating to the ear, eye, and neck on the side of the extracted tooth. The patient noticed a complete loss of the blood clot, leaving behind a dry socket with visible bone. She has been experiencing a foul odor from her mouth and an unpleasant taste. Notably, the patient has no significant medical history or lifestyle habits that may contribute to the observed symptoms. The diagnostic process will involve careful examination and X-rays to confirm the condition and guide appropriate management.",
  "Dry socket (alveolar osteitis)_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 50-year-old male patient, with a history of bruxism, presented with persistent, severe pain (rated 8/10) in the area where a tooth was extracted four days ago. The patient reported a partial loss of the blood clot, and the socket has an empty, dry appearance with visible bone. The pain radiates from the extraction site to his ear, eye, and neck on the same side of his face. Additionally, he has noticed a persistent bad breath and unpleasant taste in his mouth. The patient's bruxism history is a notable contextual factor.
