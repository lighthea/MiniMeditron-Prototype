  "Cervical incompetence_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 29-year-old female, G2P1 (Gravida 2, Para 1), presented with a concerning obstetric history. She experienced a second trimester miscarriage in her previous pregnancy, which occurred without any identifiable precipitating factors or pain. The patient is currently in her 16th week of gestation and has reported a painless vaginal discharge. Upon examination, cervical dilatation was observed. The patient has no history of cervical procedures or trauma. Given her previous obstetric history and the current presentation of painless cervical dilatation in the second trimester, further evaluation is warranted.",
  "Cervical incompetence_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 33-year-old woman, G3P2 (Gravida 3, Para 2), with a history of late second trimester pregnancy loss in her second pregnancy, presented with a medical concern at 22 weeks of gestation. The patient reported a painless gush of fluid from the vagina, consistent with premature rupture of membranes. Physical examination revealed cervical dilatation without uterine contractions. Notably, the patient had no prior history of cervical surgeries or procedures. Given her obstetric history and the current presentation of painless cervical dilatation in the second trimester, there is a high index of suspicion for the condition, necessitating prompt evaluation and management.",
  "Cervical incompetence_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 31-year-old woman, G4P1 (Gravida 4, Para 1), presented with a history of early third trimester delivery in her previous pregnancy. She is currently at 28 weeks of gestation and reported intermittent, painless contractions. On examination, cervical dilatation was noted, along with a soft cervix. The patient has no prior history of cervical interventions or trauma. Given her recurrent late pregnancy complications and the current presentation of painless cervical dilatation with preterm contractions, there is a strong clinical suspicion of cervical incompetence, mandating immediate assessment and appropriate management to mitigate the risk of preterm delivery."
