  "Pancreatitis_1": "Patient A, a 45-year-old male, presents with recurring episodes of upper abdominal pain, which he describes as severe (7/10) and persistent, often radiating to his back. He reports tenderness in the abdominal region upon examination. The pain worsens after meals and is associated with nausea, vomiting, and an unintentional weight loss of 10 pounds over the last three months. Further, he has a history of chronic alcohol consumption, averaging four standard drinks per day for the past ten years. Considering the contextual information, the etiology of pancreatitis in this case may be attributed to alcohol consumption, and it significantly impacts the diagnostic evaluation and management of the patient's condition.",
  "Pancreatitis_2": "Patient B, a 35-year-old female, seeks medical attention for recurrent upper abdominal pain and tenderness, which she rates as moderate in intensity (5/10). The pain frequently radiates to her back and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and a persistent low-grade fever. She reports that the abdominal discomfort worsens after meals. Notably, she has a family history of pancreatitis, with her father diagnosed with the condition at the age of 40. These contextual factors are vital in assessing the diagnostic implications and possible hereditary link to her current symptoms.",
  "Pancreatitis_3": "Patient C, a 50-year-old male with a history of obesity and type 2 diabetes, presents with chronic upper abdominal pain, which he characterizes as dull but constant. The pain often radiates to his back and is associated with tenderness upon abdominal palpation. He experiences episodes of nausea, vomiting, and has noticed an unintentional weight loss of 15 pounds in the last two months. Additionally, he reports oily, smelly stools (steatorrhea). Given his obesity, diabetes, and lifestyle factors, these contextual elements are critical in evaluating the diagnostic process and guiding the management of his condition."
