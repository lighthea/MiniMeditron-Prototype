  "Lung Cancer_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 57-year-old male, with a significant 30 pack-year smoking history, presents with a persistent cough, lasting for over six weeks. The cough is frequently accompanied by hemoptysis, and he reports a sharp, localized chest pain that worsens during deep breathing or coughing, rating it at 6/10 on the pain scale. He has also experienced unexplained weight loss of 15 pounds in the last three months. Despite multiple attempts, the patient has been unable to quit smoking. Given his substantial smoking history and the constellation of symptoms, there is a high index of suspicion for a pulmonary malignancy. Further diagnostic evaluation is warranted to determine the underlying etiology.",
  "Lung Cancer_2": "\n    Patient Description 2:\n    Mrs. X, a 65-year-old female, former smoker (40 pack-year history), presents with a chronic, nagging cough that has persisted for the past eight months. She describes the cough as non-productive but increasingly bothersome, with a severity rating of 4/10. The patient has also noticed a recurrent dull ache in her chest, which she attributes to her long history of smoking. She reports no recent weight changes. Despite quitting smoking 10 years ago, her symptoms have not improved. Given her age, smoking history, and prolonged, refractory cough, the possibility of an underlying lung pathology, such as lung cancer, needs to be carefully investigated.",
  "Lung Cancer_3": "\n    Patient Description 3:\n    A 60-year-old male, with a 25 pack-year history of smoking, presents with a persistent cough that has persisted for four months. He reports an intermittent, low-grade fever and night sweats, further complicating his condition. The cough is non-productive and is associated with mild chest discomfort, which he rates at 3/10 in terms of pain severity. The patient's medical history is unremarkable, and he stopped smoking 18 years ago. The presence of fever, night sweats, and a prolonged cough in a former smoker raises concerns about an underlying pulmonary pathology, necessitating a comprehensive diagnostic workup to ascertain the nature of his symptoms."
