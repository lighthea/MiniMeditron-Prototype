  "Ovarian Neoplasms, Ovarian Cysts_1": "    Patient A, a 35-year-old female, presents with a three-month history of progressively worsening pelvic pain, which she describes as a persistent dull ache (rated 5/10) in her lower abdomen. She reports a noticeable bloating sensation and a feeling of fullness, especially after meals. Notably, she has a family history of ovarian neoplasms. Physical examination reveals mild abdominal distension and tenderness upon palpation in the lower abdominal quadrants. Given the resource-constrained setting, it is essential to approach her diagnostic workup judiciously to evaluate the etiology of her symptoms and determine the presence of ovarian neoplasms or cysts.",
  "Ovarian Neoplasms, Ovarian Cysts_2": "    Patient B, a 28-year-old woman, presents with a one-year history of irregular menstrual cycles and chronic pelvic pain. She describes her pelvic pain as intermittent, colicky (rated 6/10), and localized to the lower abdomen, often radiating to her lower back. She has also noticed an increase in the frequency of urination and occasional constipation. Additionally, she reports a family history of ovarian cysts. Physical examination reveals tenderness upon palpation in the lower abdominal region. Given the patient's symptoms and family history, a comprehensive diagnostic approach is crucial in this resource-constrained setting to assess the presence of ovarian neoplasms or cysts and to determine an appropriate management plan for her condition.",
  "Ovarian Neoplasms, Ovarian Cysts_3": "    Patient C, a 40-year-old female, presents with a six-month history of persistent bloating, early satiety, and a feeling of heaviness in her lower abdomen, accompanied by mild, intermittent pelvic pain (rated 4/10). She has no significant family history of gynecological conditions. The pelvic pain is described as dull and crampy, primarily localized to the lower abdominal region. Physical examination reveals mild abdominal distension. Given the non-specific nature of her symptoms and the resource-constrained setting, a careful diagnostic assessment is pivotal to discern the etiology of her complaints and to rule out the presence of ovarian neoplasms or cysts."
