  "Scrotal mass_1": "    Description 1:\n    A 32-year-old male patient presented with a concerning scrotal mass, which he noticed as an unusual lump during self-examination. The lump is associated with sudden and intermittent sharp pain, rated at 6/10 on the pain scale. The patient also reports a dull aching pain and a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum, which sometimes radiates throughout the groin, abdomen, and lower back. On examination, we observed a tender, swollen, and hardened left testicle, as well as swelling in the scrotum with redness of the skin. The patient denied any history of undescended or retractile testicle, and there is no family history of testicular cancer. However, he did report a recent groin injury from a sports-related incident. Further evaluation is warranted to determine the nature of the scrotal mass and develop an appropriate management plan.",
  "Scrotal mass_2": "    Description 2:\n    A 25-year-old male patient presented with a scrotal mass, which he noticed as an unusual lump three weeks ago. The patient described a gradual onset of dull aching pain and a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum, rated at 4/10 in intensity. He also experienced intermittent pain that radiates from the scrotum to the groin and lower abdomen. On examination, his right epididymis was tender, swollen, and hardened. There is no history of undescended or retractile testicle, and the patient denied any family history of testicular cancer. However, he reported a recent episode of urinary frequency and a mild fever. The presence of these symptoms necessitates further diagnostic investigation to determine the underlying cause of the scrotal mass.",
  "Scrotal mass_3": "    Description 3:\n    A 40-year-old male patient presented with a scrotal mass and a history of recurrent testicular pain. He described the pain as a dull ache and rated it at 3/10 in intensity, often accompanied by a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum. The pain occasionally radiates into his lower back. On examination, we noted a tender, swollen, and hardened right testicle. The patient had a history of an undescended testicle in childhood, which was surgically corrected. There is no family history of testicular cancer, and the patient denied any recent groin injuries or urinary symptoms. However, he reported a previous diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection, which was successfully treated. Given the patient's history and the current presentation, a comprehensive diagnostic assessment is necessary to determine the etiology of the scrotal mass and optimize the management approach."
