  "Drug-Susceptible Tuberculosis_1": "    Patient A, a 38-year-old male with a history of HIV infection, presented with a persistent productive cough that has lasted for over three weeks, accompanied by intermittent low-grade fevers and night sweats. He described his chest pain as dull and constant, localized to the right upper chest, with a severity rating of 4 on a scale of 1 to 10. Despite a noticeable fatigue, he reported an unintentional weight loss of 15 pounds over the past two months. Chest radiography revealed abnormalities, and the patient's CD4 count was below 200 cells/mm\u00b3. Given his HIV status and the nature of his symptoms, there is a high index of suspicion for drug-susceptible tuberculosis, which necessitates further diagnostic evaluation and prompt intervention.",
  "Drug-Susceptible Tuberculosis_2": "    Patient B, a 55-year-old female, presented with a chronic cough of six weeks duration, accompanied by intermittent low-grade fevers and night sweats. She reported a persistent, sharp chest pain localized to the right mid-chest area, with a severity rating of 6 on a scale of 1 to 10. The patient also complained of generalized fatigue and a notable unintentional weight loss of 20 pounds over the past three months. Chest radiography revealed abnormalities consistent with the disease. Notably, she has no known history of HIV infection. The combination of symptoms, along with radiographic findings, raises a strong suspicion of drug-susceptible tuberculosis, necessitating further diagnostic workup.",
  "Drug-Susceptible Tuberculosis_3": "    Patient C, a 45-year-old male with no known HIV infection, presented with a productive cough that has persisted for four weeks, along with intermittent low-grade fevers and night sweats. He described his chest pain as aching and localized to the left lower chest, with a severity rating of 3 on a scale of 1 to 10. The patient reported a gradual onset of fatigue and an unintentional weight loss of 18 pounds over the past two months. Chest radiography revealed abnormalities consistent with the disease. Given the patient's symptoms and radiographic findings, there is a strong suspicion of drug-susceptible tuberculosis, which warrants further diagnostic evaluation and intervention."
