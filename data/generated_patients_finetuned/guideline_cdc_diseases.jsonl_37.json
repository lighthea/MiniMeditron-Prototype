She reported a persistent low-grade fever and a mild headache, accompanied by general discomfort. The patient also complained of mild pink eye, swollen and enlarged lymph nodes, as well as a runny nose and a cough. Given her pregnancy status, there is a heightened concern due to the potential risk of congenital rubella syndrome if the diagnosis is confirmed. It is essential to promptly assess and manage her condition to minimize the risk to the developing fetus.",
  "Rubella_2": "    Description 2:\n    A 35-year-old male patient, with no significant medical history, presented with a red rash that started on his face and has since spread to other parts of his body. The patient reported a persistent low-grade fever, a moderate headache, and general discomfort. He also experienced swollen and enlarged lymph nodes, along with a cough and runny nose. Physical examination revealed the characteristic red rash and confirmed the presence of rubella-related symptoms. The patient's condition is causing mild to moderate distress, and due to the contagious nature of rubella, appropriate measures need to be taken to prevent its spread to susceptible individuals, especially those who are unvaccinated or at higher risk.",
