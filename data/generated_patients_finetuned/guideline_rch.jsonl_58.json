  "Preschool asthma_1": "**Patient Description 1:**\nA 4-year-old patient, with a history of eczema, presented with a recurrent cough, wheezing episodes (rated 7/10 for severity), and difficulty breathing, particularly during physical activities, indicating activity limitation. The child's parents reported the presence of daytime symptoms, as well as coughing and wheezing at night or upon waking. The patient has a documented history of previous use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), and there are concerns about the adequacy of their inhaler technique. Objective tests are limited in this age group, and the presence of eczema and allergic rhinitis complicates the diagnostic process, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation to differentiate the symptoms. The need for systemic corticosteroids or emergency department visits has not been reported thus far.",
  "Preschool asthma_2": "**Patient Description 2:**\nA 3-year-old, whose older sibling has a history of allergic rhinitis, presented with a persistent cough and recurrent episodes of wheeze, rated at 6/10 for severity. The child's preschool teachers observed activity limitation due to difficulty breathing during playtime. The parents reported the presence of interval symptoms, including daytime cough and wheeze, as well as nighttime respiratory issues. There is no documented history of systemic corticosteroid use, ED presentations, or hospital admissions for asthma treatment. However, the family history of allergic rhinitis raises concerns about potential comorbidities. The lack of objective tests and the overlap with other common conditions necessitate a comprehensive evaluation to establish a diagnosis.",
  "Preschool asthma_3": "**Patient Description 3:**\nA 5-year-old patient, with a history of recurrent wheezing episodes, cough, and difficulty breathing during physical activities, presented with a multifaceted symptom profile. The wheezing episodes have been bothering the child for several months, with a severity rating of 8/10. The parents noted interval symptoms, including daytime cough and wheeze, as well as activity limitation. Additionally, the child experienced respiratory symptoms at night or upon waking. There is a documented history of ICS use, and concerns have been raised about the patient's inhaler technique. The diagnostic process is complicated by the lack of objective tests and the presence of comorbidities such as allergic rhinitis. Height and weight measurements, as well as a comprehensive assessment, are essential for differentiating the condition and optimizing the management plan."
