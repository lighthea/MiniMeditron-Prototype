  "Murray Valley Encephalitis virus_2": "    **Patient Description 2:**\n    A 32-year-old female patient presented with a fever of 101.5\u00b0F (38.6\u00b0C), moderate to severe headaches, and persistent nausea. The patient reported a recent trip to Indonesia, where she spent a significant amount of time outdoors. Her occupation as a field researcher often involves outdoor activities in various regions. The onset of symptoms coincided with the summer season. The patient has a history of migraines, but the current headache is described as notably different and more intense. She also experienced recurrent vomiting episodes. Although no overt confusion is reported, the patient expressed a feeling of overall tiredness and malaise. Given the travel history, outdoor exposure, and the specific geographical context, a comprehensive evaluation is warranted.",
  "Murray Valley Encephalitis virus_3": "    **Patient Description 3:**\n    A 50-year-old male patient, with no significant travel history, presented with a persistent fever of 101.8\u00b0F (38.8\u00b0C) and severe headaches that have persisted for over a week. The patient's occupation involves indoor desk work, and there are no notable outdoor activities or recent travel to high-risk regions. The fever is accompanied by frequent nausea and vomiting episodes. The patient has no history of migraines. Neurological assessment revealed a subtle but concerning decline in cognitive function, with episodes of confusion. Additionally, the patient experienced a single, prolonged seizure episode. There is also evidence of a lack of coordination in motor skills. The atypical presentation in a non-endemic area raises diagnostic challenges, and further investigation is crucial to determine the underlying cause."
