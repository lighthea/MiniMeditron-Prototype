  "Pulmonary embolism_1": "\n# Patient Description 1:\nA 45-year-old female patient with a significant medical history of obesity and a sedentary lifestyle presented with sudden-onset severe chest pain, which she described as 8/10 on the pain scale, accompanied by shortness of breath. She also reported a persistent cough with blood-streaked mucus. The patient had a rapid heartbeat, and she experienced lightheadedness and excessive sweating. On physical examination, mild fever was noted. Given her underlying risk factors, including obesity, the presence of these symptoms raises concerns about a potential pulmonary embolism. Further diagnostic evaluation, including imaging studies, is warranted to assess the size of the blood clot and determine an appropriate management plan.",
  "Pulmonary embolism_2": "# Patient Description 2:\nA 60-year-old male patient, known for a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and recent immobilization due to a leg injury, presented with lightheadedness, dizziness, and a persistent cough with bloody sputum. He reported a dull chest pain, with a severity of 5/10, which had been ongoing for the past two days. The patient also had a low-grade fever. Physical examination revealed clammy skin and mild leg swelling. Given the presence of COPD, immobilization, and the described symptoms, there is a high index of suspicion for pulmonary embolism. Diagnostic assessment, considering the potential presence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and the size of the blood clot, is imperative to guide appropriate treatment.",
  "Pulmonary embolism_3": "# Patient Description 3:\nA 30-year-old female patient, who recently underwent a long-haul flight, presented with sudden-onset chest pain, which she rated as 7/10 in intensity, along with shortness of breath and a dry cough. She reported fainting episodes and had episodes of rapid, irregular heartbeat. The patient also complained of excessive sweating and a low-grade fever. Given her recent prolonged immobility during the flight, the constellation of symptoms raises concern for a possible pulmonary embolism. It is crucial to conduct diagnostic investigations to evaluate the size of the blood clot, considering the patient's recent travel history and the presence of these alarming symptoms."
