  "IgA nephropathy (Berger disease)_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 32-year-old male, with a family history of kidney disease, presented with a complex set of symptoms. He reported persistent pain on the right side of his back, radiating below the ribs, which he rated at 6/10 in severity. The patient also described his urine as foamy and noted the presence of cola-colored appearance intermittently. Examination revealed visible blood in the urine, along with swelling in his hands and feet (edema). Notably, he has a history of celiac disease, which may be a relevant factor. The presence of these symptoms, along with the family history and celiac disease, underscores the need for comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to assess the underlying etiology.",
  "IgA nephropathy (Berger disease)_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 45-year-old female patient, of Asian ethnicity, presented with a myriad of concerning symptoms. She reported a persistent metallic taste in her mouth, along with recurrent episodes of upset stomach and vomiting. The patient also described her urine as tea-colored, with visible blood, and noted foamy urine. Additionally, she had been experiencing muscle cramps and generalized weakness, contributing to a notable decline in her energy levels. On examination, she was found to have elevated blood pressure. Given her ethnic background and the combination of symptoms, including gastrointestinal disturbances, hematuria, and weakness, a comprehensive diagnostic workup is imperative to elucidate the underlying condition.",
  "IgA nephropathy (Berger disease)_3": "    Patient Description 3:\n    A 52-year-old male patient, with a known history of liver disease, presented with a complex array of symptoms. He reported a persistent cola-colored urine, often accompanied by foamy appearance. The patient described significant pain on both sides of his back below the ribs, which he rated at 7/10 in severity. In addition to these renal symptoms, he reported rashes and pruritus on his skin, as well as episodes of confusion. Notably, he had a history of liver disease, which could influence the clinical presentation. The presence of these symptoms, along with the history of liver disease, warrants a comprehensive diagnostic assessment to discern the underlying etiology and its potential relationship with the hepatic condition."
