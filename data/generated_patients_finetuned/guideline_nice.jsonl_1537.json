  "Non-melanoma skin tumours (including premalignant and primary non-metastatic skin lesions)_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 58-year-old male patient, with a history of chronic sun exposure due to outdoor work, presented with a slow-growing, locally invasive epidermal skin tumour on his right forearm. The lesion is approximately 2 cm in diameter and has a hardened texture. The patient reported occasional pruritus and tenderness in the affected area, with a pain level rated at 3 on a scale of 10. Given the contextual information of high recurrence rates and the risk of metastasis, along with the patient's sun-exposed occupation, a comprehensive skin examination is warranted to assess the extent of the lesion and potential involvement of nearby lymph nodes.",
  "Non-melanoma skin tumours (including premalignant and primary non-metastatic skin lesions)_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 65-year-old female patient, with a history of long-term outdoor recreational activities, presented with multiple small lumps of hard skin on her face and neck. These lesions are consistent with an early form of non-melanoma skin cancer, arising from cells in the epidermis and spreading into the surrounding skin. The patient has a notable history of actinic keratoses in sun-exposed areas. She described a persistent sensation of roughness and occasional pain (rated at 2 out of 10 in intensity) in the affected regions. Given the possibility of progression to invasive squamous cell carcinoma, a biopsy of the lesions is essential to determine the appropriate treatment and assess the risk of malignant transformation.",
  "Non-melanoma skin tumours (including premalignant and primary non-metastatic skin lesions)_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 70-year-old male patient, who had previously undergone treatments for non-melanoma skin tumours, presented with a recurrent lesion on his left cheek. The lesion, which had been previously treated with cryotherapy, has reappeared and grown in size. The patient reported a pain level of 4 out of 10 and expressed concerns about the cosmetic impact and the need for retreatment. Given the history of recurrent tumours and the ineffectiveness of prior treatment, a comprehensive evaluation is necessary to determine the nature of the lesion and the most suitable approach for retreatment. The patient's age and the location of the lesion also raise the possibility of extensive tissue destruction, emphasizing the need for a thorough management strategy."
