  "Encopresis_1": "     Patient A, an 8-year-old girl, was brought in by her parents with a concerning history of leakage of stool in her underwear, accompanied by constipation and the passage of dry, hard stool. The parents reported that she experiences a lack of appetite and often avoids bowel movements, leading to long gaps between defecation. The patient frequently complains of abdominal pain, which she rates at a 6/10 on the pain scale. Notably, she has a history of ADHD, for which she is on medication. The family mentioned recent emotional stressors, as the patient's parents are going through a divorce. Additionally, she has had repeated bladder infections. These symptoms have persisted despite attempts at dietary changes and laxative use. The constellation of her clinical presentation, including the contextual information, poses a diagnostic challenge that requires a comprehensive evaluation.",
  "Encopresis_2": "     Patient B, a 6-year-old boy, presented with a complex set of symptoms, including leakage of liquid stool in his underwear, as well as recurrent constipation characterized by the passage of large, hard stools that often clog the toilet. His parents reported that he actively avoids bowel movements and experiences a notable lack of appetite. The patient has a history of autism spectrum disorder and is currently undergoing behavioral therapy. Moreover, he has been dealing with daytime wetting issues (enuresis). The family highlighted the challenges of toilet training, given the patient's neurodevelopmental condition. Despite their efforts to establish a consistent routine, the patient's symptoms persist, and he often complains of abdominal pain, which he rates at 5/10 in intensity. His medical history and the contextual factors associated with his autism spectrum disorder add complexity to the diagnostic process.",
  "Encopresis_3": "     Patient C, a 7-year-old boy, was referred for an evaluation due to the leakage of stool in his underwear and chronic constipation characterized by the passage of dry, hard stool, often leading to toilet-clogging incidents. He experiences prolonged periods between bowel movements and reports a lack of appetite. The patient has a history of anxiety, and his parents described how the fear of bowel movements has led to avoidance behaviors. They highlighted the impact of his anxiety on his toilet habits and noted a recent increase in his symptoms following a stressful event at school, where he was teased by classmates. The patient also presents with occasional abdominal pain, rated at 4/10. Despite efforts to address his anxiety, including counseling, his bowel-related issues persist. The interplay between his anxiety, recent stressors, and the observed symptoms presents a diagnostic challenge that necessitates a comprehensive assessment."
