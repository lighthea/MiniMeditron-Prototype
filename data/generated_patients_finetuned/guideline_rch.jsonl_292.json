  "Pain management in the acutely unwell neonate and/or post-operative period_1": "Case 1:\nA 3-day-old neonate, born at 36 weeks of gestation, is presenting with severe agitation and distress, accompanied by sweating and tachycardia. The infant had a brief exposure to opioids in utero due to maternal medication. The mother has a history of opioid use, and the neonate's symptoms began shortly after birth. Standard non-pharmacological pain management measures have been ineffective in alleviating the infant's symptoms. The patient's pain level is assessed as 8/10. Given the combination of symptoms, history of opioid exposure, and the neonate's gestational age, a comprehensive assessment for neonatal abstinence syndrome and appropriate pain control interventions is warranted.",
  "Pain management in the acutely unwell neonate and/or post-operative period_2": "Case 2:\nA 5-day-old neonate, born at 38 weeks of gestation, is post-operatively experiencing respiratory depression and poor blood pressure control following a surgical procedure for the placement of a medical device. The infant's pain expression is challenging to assess due to the nature of the surgical intervention. The patient's gestational age, type of surgical procedure, and medical device placement are all relevant contextual factors. Despite initial pain management efforts, the neonate's respiratory depression and inadequate blood pressure control persist. Close monitoring and a comprehensive pain assessment are essential to address the respiratory and cardiovascular effects, as well as to prevent further complications.",
  "Pain management in the acutely unwell neonate and/or post-operative period_3": "Case 3:\nA post-operative 2-month-old infant, with no previous exposure to opioids, is displaying rebound hypertension and sweating, along with tachycardia. The neonate underwent a surgical procedure for limb fracture repair. The current symptoms of hypertension, tachycardia, and sweating are atypical in the post-operative period and raise concerns about adequate pain management. The baby's pain level is reported as 7/10. Given the history of limb fractures, the nature of the surgical procedure, and the observed rebound hypertension, a thorough assessment is necessary to address the infant's pain and cardiovascular symptoms effectively."
