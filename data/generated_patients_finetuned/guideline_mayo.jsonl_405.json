  "Foot drop_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 45-year-old male patient, with a history of prolonged squatting due to his occupation as a carpenter, presented with a concerning gait abnormality. He reported difficulty in lifting the front part of his right foot and consistently noticed his foot dragging on the ground while walking, particularly when fatigued. This has led to a \"slapping\" sound as his right foot strikes the floor with each step. The patient described a persistent, bothersome numbness on the top of his right foot and toes. Physical examination revealed a steppage gait, wherein he raised his right thigh more than usual during ambulation. Notably, the symptoms are confined to the right foot. The patient's occupation and lifestyle contribute significantly to the observed presentation.",
  "Foot drop_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 60-year-old female patient, with a history of wearing a leg cast following a previous ankle fracture, sought medical evaluation for an ongoing issue with her left foot. She described a consistent difficulty in lifting the front part of her left foot and reported that her foot frequently dragged on the ground while walking. The patient articulated a sensation of \"slapping\" as her left foot made contact with the floor during ambulation. Additionally, she experienced numbness on the top of her left foot and toes. These symptoms were not observed in the right foot. The patient's history of wearing a leg cast is a relevant contextual factor.",
