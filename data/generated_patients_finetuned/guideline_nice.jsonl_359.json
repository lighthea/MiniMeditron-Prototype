  "Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria_1": " Description 1:\nI evaluated a 38-year-old male patient with a history of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) who presented with a significant increase in symptoms suggestive of high disease activity, including severe fatigue, recurrent episodes of dark urine indicative of haemolysis, and elevated bilirubin levels. Despite prior treatment with eculizumab for more than 6 months, the patient's condition has shown a noticeable escalation, impacting his quality of life. The diagnostic process is further complicated by the need to consider the disease stability after eculizumab therapy and the relevant commercial arrangement by the company.",
  "Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria_2": "Description 2:\nA 45-year-old female patient, known case of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH), was referred to our clinic with pronounced clinical manifestations of haemolysis and high disease activity. The patient reported experiencing debilitating fatigue, along with a persistent increase in the severity and frequency of dark urine, indicative of ongoing haemolysis. Her medical history includes a six-month eculizumab treatment, yet the current escalation in symptoms raises concerns about the disease's stability despite the prior therapy. The diagnostic process is further complicated by the commercial arrangement by the company, necessitating additional considerations.",
  "Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria_3": "Description 3:\nToday, a 50-year-old male patient with a confirmed diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) presented with compelling clinical symptoms, including severe fatigue and recurrent episodes of dark urine, consistent with active haemolysis. Despite a history of eculizumab therapy for over 6 months, the patient's condition has deteriorated, posing significant challenges in disease management. The observed escalation in symptoms necessitates a comprehensive assessment, with due consideration given to the disease's stability following eculizumab treatment and the impact of the commercial arrangement by the company on diagnostic approaches."
