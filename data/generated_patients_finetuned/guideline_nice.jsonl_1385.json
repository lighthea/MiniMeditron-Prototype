  "Symptomatic degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine_1": "    Case 1:\n    A 45-year-old male patient, with a history of previous lower back injury from a sporting accident, presented with chronic lower back pain persisting for the past 18 months. The pain, rated as 7/10 on the visual analog scale, is described as a dull, aching sensation, with frequent episodes of shooting pain radiating down the left leg. The radicular pain is reported to worsen during prolonged standing or walking. Notably, conventional treatment modalities, including physical therapy and analgesic medications, have provided minimal relief. Given the patient's age, history of injury, and the ineffectiveness of standard treatments, a comprehensive diagnostic workup is warranted to evaluate the underlying etiology of his debilitating symptoms.",
  "Symptomatic degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine_2": "    Case 2:\n    A 55-year-old female patient, employed in a sedentary desk job, presented with a protracted history of chronic lower back pain. The pain, rated at 6/10 in intensity, is characterized as a persistent, dull ache in the lumbar region, frequently accompanied by shooting radicular pain traveling down her right leg. The symptoms have been ongoing for over two years and are notably exacerbated during prolonged sitting or forward bending. Despite attempts at conservative management with ergonomic adjustments and pharmacotherapy, there has been limited amelioration of her discomfort. Given the patient's occupation and the prolonged duration of her symptoms, a comprehensive diagnostic assessment is crucial to elucidate the nature of her condition and explore alternative therapeutic interventions.",
