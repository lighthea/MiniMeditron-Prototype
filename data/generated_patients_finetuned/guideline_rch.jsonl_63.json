  "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)_1": "\tDescription 1:\nA 6-year-old male patient, without any significant perinatal or postnatal complications, has been referred to our clinic due to concerns about his developmental milestones. The patient's parents have observed pronounced impaired social communication and interaction, as the child struggles to maintain eye contact, engage in reciprocal conversation, and demonstrate age-appropriate social-emotional reciprocity. Additionally, the patient exhibits restrictive, repetitive patterns of behavior, particularly in his adherence to daily routines and a strong attachment to specific objects. The parents have also noticed sensory sensitivities in their child, who frequently becomes distressed and irritable in response to loud or unexpected sounds, bright lights, and certain textures. Notably, the patient has a family history of neurodevelopmental disorders. These symptoms have persisted for more than 6 months and are significantly impacting the child's functioning across different settings.",
  "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)_2": "Description 2:\nA 9-year-old female patient, with a complex perinatal history involving prematurity and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, is being evaluated for developmental concerns. The patient presents with impaired social communication and interaction, as evidenced by difficulties in understanding and appropriately using nonverbal communication, as well as challenges in forming and maintaining peer relationships. Moreover, she displays restrictive, repetitive patterns of behavior, often insisting on sameness and exhibiting intense, circumscribed interests. The patient's parents have reported sensory sensitivities, particularly to loud or unexpected sounds, which frequently lead to emotional distress and behavioral dysregulation. Given the patient's NICU history and associated neurodevelopmental risks, her presentation raises concerns about a potential coexisting neurodevelopmental comorbidity. These symptoms have been noticeable since early childhood and have persisted despite various supportive interventions.",
  "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)_3": "Description 3:\nA 14-year-old male patient, with a family history of psychiatric disorders, is being assessed for ongoing behavioral and developmental challenges. The patient exhibits impaired social communication and interaction, struggling with understanding social cues, making friendships, and engaging in age-appropriate peer interactions. Moreover, he displays pronounced restrictive, repetitive patterns of behavior, such as rigid adherence to specific routines and intense fixations on certain topics. His parents have observed sensory sensitivities, particularly to light and colors, which frequently result in discomfort and emotional outbursts. The patient's presentation is further complicated by his coexisting psychiatric family history, raising concerns about associated psychiatric disorders. These symptoms have been persistent throughout his childhood and are impacting his academic and social functioning. Previous interventions have provided limited improvement in his overall presentation.\n"
