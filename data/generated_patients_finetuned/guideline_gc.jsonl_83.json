  "Colon Cancer_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 48-year-old male patient, with a significant family history of colorectal cancer, presented with persistent changes in bowel habits, including alternating constipation and diarrhea over the past six months. He reported a dull, persistent abdominal discomfort localized in the left lower quadrant, which he rated as 4/10 on the pain scale. Despite dietary modifications, the patient experienced unintentional weight loss of 10 lbs over the last two months. His past medical history is unremarkable, and he has not undergone any previous colorectal cancer screening. Laboratory tests revealed an elevated CEA level. Physical examination showed mild tenderness in the left lower abdomen. Given the patient's symptoms, family history, and elevated CEA level, a full colonic evaluation with histologic assessment is warranted to determine the diagnosis.",
  "Colon Cancer_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 56-year-old female patient, with a strong family history of colon cancer, presented with concerning symptoms. She reported recurrent episodes of bright red blood in her stools for the past three months. The bleeding was not associated with hemorrhoids and occurred intermittently, accompanied by mild abdominal cramping rated at 3/10 in intensity. The patient's bowel habits had also changed, with increased frequency and a feeling of incomplete evacuation. She had noticed a decrease in her energy levels and experienced unintentional weight loss of 8 lbs. Despite her family history, the patient had not undergone any colorectal cancer screening previously. Physical examination revealed no significant findings. Given the patient's family history, disease-specific symptoms, and the presence of rectal bleeding, a comprehensive diagnostic workup, including a full colonic evaluation, is crucial for accurate assessment and management.",
  "Colon Cancer_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 60-year-old male patient, without a documented family history of colon cancer, presented with a two-month history of persistent, crampy abdominal pain primarily localized in the lower abdomen, which he rated as 6/10 in intensity. He described a noticeable change in his bowel habits, with increased frequency and the sensation of incomplete evacuation. The patient had experienced unintentional weight loss of 12 lbs and noted occasional episodes of blood in his stools. His past medical history was unremarkable, and he had not undergone colorectal cancer screening before. Physical examination revealed mild tenderness in the lower abdomen. Laboratory tests indicated an elevated CEA level. Given the combination of disease-specific symptoms, elevated CEA level, and the patient's age, a comprehensive diagnostic workup, including a full colonic evaluation and radiologic staging, is essential to establish the diagnosis and determine the extent of the disease according to the AJCC/TNM staging system."
