  "Speech and Language Delay and Disorders in Children Age 5 and Younger_1": "    Description 1:\n    A 4-year-old male patient was brought in by his parents, who have a low education level, for an evaluation of speech and language delays. The child is exhibiting difficulty with articulation and pronunciation, with a limited vocabulary compared to peers. His parents have also observed trouble understanding others, following directions, and engaging in social interaction. There is no history of previous interventions or treatments for these delays. The presence of male sex and low parental education are contextual factors to consider in the diagnostic process.",
  "Speech and Language Delay and Disorders in Children Age 5 and Younger_2": "    Description 2:\n    We assessed a 5-year-old female patient with a family history of speech and language impairment for her notable speech delays and language difficulties. The child's parents reported challenges in grammar, syntax, and phonological development. Despite parental efforts and involvement, the patient's language skills remain below the expected level for her age. The family history of speech and language impairment is a relevant contextual factor in this case.",
  "Speech and Language Delay and Disorders in Children Age 5 and Younger_3": "    Description 3:\n    A 3-year-old male patient, born prematurely, was brought in for an evaluation of delayed speech and language development. The child's perinatal history includes prematurity and low birth weight, which are important contextual factors for assessment. The parents have observed difficulty with articulation, understanding others, and following directions. The patient's phonological development is delayed, and he exhibits limited vocabulary, all of which have not shown significant improvement with age. These symptoms, combined with the perinatal risk factors, lead to a comprehensive evaluation."
