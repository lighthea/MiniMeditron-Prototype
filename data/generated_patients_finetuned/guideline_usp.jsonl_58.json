  "Unhealthy Alcohol Use_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 35-year-old male patient with a history of chronic alcohol consumption presented with recurrent episodes of upper abdominal discomfort, rated at 5/10 in intensity, often accompanied by a gnawing sensation. He admits to a pattern of heavy alcohol use and has experienced a recent decline in liver function, as indicated by elevated liver enzymes on laboratory tests. The patient's lifestyle is notably characterized by regular heavy drinking, and he acknowledges facing social and occupational consequences due to his alcohol consumption. Notably, he does not have any comorbid substance use. Given his age and the observed pattern of unhealthy alcohol use, further assessment is warranted to address his condition.",
  "Unhealthy Alcohol Use_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 28-year-old female patient, who is currently pregnant, presented with concerns about her alcohol consumption. Despite receiving counseling during her prenatal care, she has been unable to abstain from drinking and reports consuming alcohol on a regular basis. She described experiencing feelings of guilt and worry related to her drinking behavior. The patient's obstetric history is unremarkable, and she is committed to seeking help for her alcohol use during pregnancy. Given the contextual factor of pregnancy and the patient's self-reported unhealthy alcohol use, a comprehensive evaluation and intervention are essential to address her condition and safeguard the well-being of the fetus.",
  "Unhealthy Alcohol Use_3": "    Patient Description 3:\n    A 42-year-old male patient, without a documented history of alcohol-related issues, presented with a myriad of vague symptoms, including persistent fatigue, insomnia, and irritability. He describes his overall well-being as suboptimal and has noticed a decline in his work performance. The patient's social history reveals an escalation in alcohol consumption over the past year, with daily intake exceeding recommended limits. While he initially used alcohol as a coping mechanism for work-related stress, it has now become a habitual pattern. His self-reported alcohol use is impacting his quality of life and interpersonal relationships. Despite no prior diagnosis of unhealthy alcohol use, the presence of escalating consumption, coupled with the observed physical and emotional symptoms, necessitates a comprehensive assessment to address his condition."
