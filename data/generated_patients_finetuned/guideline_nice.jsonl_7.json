  "Idiopathic chronic non-obstructive urinary retention_1": "  Patient description 1:\n  A 45-year-old male patient, with a history of lower abdominal discomfort and pain, has been experiencing persistent urinary symptoms. The patient reports an inability to completely empty his bladder during voiding, accompanied by recurrent urinary tract infections. He describes the discomfort as a dull, constant ache in his lower abdomen, with intermittent episodes of moderate pain (4-6 on a scale of 10). Despite lifestyle modifications and previous courses of antibiotics, his symptoms persist. Given the chronic nature of his condition, the presence of recurrent urinary tract infections, and lower abdominal discomfort, further evaluation is warranted to determine the underlying etiology and establish an appropriate management plan.",
