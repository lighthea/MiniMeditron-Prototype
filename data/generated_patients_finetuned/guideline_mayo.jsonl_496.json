  "Hip Labral Tear_1": "Patient A, a 35-year-old male, presents with chronic, dull aching (5/10 on the pain scale) in the right hip and groin region, which is notably exacerbated by prolonged periods of standing due to his occupation as a construction worker. He also reports a clicking sensation within the hip joint during movements, along with episodic stiffness and a limited range of motion, particularly after engaging in strenuous athletic activities. Notably, the patient has a history of participating in high-impact sports. These symptoms, combined with the contextual information of occupational demands and sports involvement, underscore the need to investigate the presence of a hip labral tear comprehensively.",
  "Hip Labral Tear_2": "Patient B, a 28-year-old female, describes persistent pain in her left hip and groin region, rated at 6/10 in intensity, which is exacerbated by prolonged periods of sitting during her desk job. Furthermore, she reports a recurrent locking sensation, as well as a pronounced clicking or catching feeling within the left hip joint. The patient has also noticed a gradual onset of stiffness and a limited range of motion in her hip, impacting her daily activities and exercise routine. With no history of trauma, her symptoms, in conjunction with the office-based lifestyle, raise strong suspicions for a hip labral tear, warranting a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.",
  "Hip Labral Tear_3": "Patient C, a 25-year-old male, presents with a persistent, sharp pain (7/10 in severity) localized to his right hip and groin area, which is exacerbated by both prolonged sitting at his desk job and during athletic activities, such as running and weightlifting. He frequently experiences a clicking sensation in the hip joint and a sensation of \"catching\" during specific movements. Additionally, the patient reports a gradual onset of stiffness and a noticeable limitation in the range of motion of his right hip. His history of active sports participation, coupled with these characteristic symptoms, underscores the need for a comprehensive diagnostic assessment to evaluate the presence of a hip labral tear."
