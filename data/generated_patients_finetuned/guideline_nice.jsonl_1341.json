  "Non-valvular atrial fibrillation_1": "    Patient 1 is a 65-year-old male with a history of non-valvular atrial fibrillation. He presents with persistent fatigue (rated 6/10 in severity) and palpitations, which have been increasingly bothersome over the past two weeks. The palpitations are accompanied by intermittent episodes of chest pain (rated 4/10) and occasional shortness of breath during exertion. The patient has not experienced any fainting spells. His medical history is notable for gastrointestinal bleeding, which may affect his ability to tolerate anticoagulant therapy. Given his symptoms and bleeding risk, an individualized approach to the diagnostic evaluation and management of his atrial fibrillation is crucial.",
  "Non-valvular atrial fibrillation_2": "    Patient 2, a 72-year-old female, has been experiencing recurrent episodes of palpitations and chest pain (rated 5/10 in severity) along with a persistent sensation of fatigue (rated 7/10). She describes occasional shortness of breath during mild physical activity. The patient has a history of non-valvular atrial fibrillation and has been on anticoagulant therapy, although she has difficulty tolerating the medication due to recurrent gastrointestinal discomfort. Her risk of thromboembolism is a key consideration in her ongoing management. A comprehensive assessment is warranted to address her symptoms, optimize her anticoagulation therapy, and explore alternative management options for her atrial fibrillation.",
  "Non-valvular atrial fibrillation_3": "    A 60-year-old male patient, known to have non-valvular atrial fibrillation, seeks medical attention for chest pain episodes (rated 6/10 in severity) accompanied by frequent palpitations and a persistent sensation of fatigue (rated 8/10). He reports intermittent shortness of breath at rest and exertional fainting. The patient has a history of alcohol use and smoking. His lifestyle factors may impact the choice of anticoagulant therapy and pose additional challenges in managing his condition. Given the severity of his symptoms and lifestyle considerations, a thorough diagnostic assessment, risk stratification, and personalized treatment plan are essential to address his non-valvular atrial fibrillation and associated symptoms effectively."
