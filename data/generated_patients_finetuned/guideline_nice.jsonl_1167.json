  "Orofacial reconstruction_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 36-year-old male patient, with a history of traumatic injury to the face following a motor vehicle accident five years ago, presents with a complex array of orofacial reconstruction-related symptoms. The patient reports a persistent facial asymmetry, rated at 7/10 on the pain scale, along with enophthalmos and diplopia in the left eye. He describes a palpable plate rim in the maxillary region and recurrent episodes of infection, which he attributes to the implant site. Notably, the extent of surrounding damage, as well as the location of the implant, are critical factors influencing the diagnostic evaluation in this case. The patient's quality of life is significantly impacted by visual deterioration, restricted ocular motility, and a palpable plate rim, despite previous treatments aimed at managing the infection and ocular symptoms.",
  "Orofacial reconstruction_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 45-year-old female patient, with a history of maxillary reconstruction using implants following a severe orofacial injury, presents with a constellation of orofacial reconstruction-related symptoms. She reports a palpable plate rim in the maxillary region, along with recurrent maxillary sinusitis and oronasal fistulae, which have been causing significant discomfort, rated at 8/10 on the pain scale. The patient's quality of life is further compromised by visual deterioration and intraconal soft tissue scarring. Diagnostic assessment is complex in this case, given the formation of soft tissue covering over the implant, which influences the extent of surrounding damage and the presentation of symptoms. Despite previous treatments for sinusitis and oronasal fistulae, the patient continues to experience persistent issues related to her orofacial reconstruction.",
  "Orofacial reconstruction_3": "    Patient Description 3:\n    A 50-year-old male patient, who underwent orofacial reconstruction with implants a decade ago following a traumatic injury, presents with a chronic and complex clinical picture. The patient describes a notable facial asymmetry, rated at 6/10 in terms of discomfort, along with enophthalmos and diplopia in the right eye. He reports visual deterioration and a palpable plate rim in the maxillary region, as well as episodes of infection and maxillary sinusitis. The diagnostic assessment is challenging, given the history of the integrated elements of the prosthesis and the potential for bone resorption and implant loosening. The extent of surrounding damage and the location of the implant are critical factors influencing the patient's presentation. Despite previous interventions, including treatments for infection and sinusitis, the patient's symptoms persist and impact his daily life significantly."
