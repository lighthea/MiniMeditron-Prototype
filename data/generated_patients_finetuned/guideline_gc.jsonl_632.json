  "Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with high thromboembolic risk who are not suited for long-term oral anticoagulation and who have adequate life expectancy (minimum >1 year) and quality of life to benefit from LAAC_1": "Description 1:\nA 68-year-old male patient with a history of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation presented with recurrent palpitations and chest discomfort. The patient's symptoms of atrial fibrillation have persisted despite previous trials of oral anticoagulation therapy, which was discontinued due to gastrointestinal bleeding. The recurrent episodes of palpitations have been associated with a feeling of anxiety and are rated at 7/10 in intensity. The patient has a good overall functional status and is motivated to explore alternative treatment options for his atrial fibrillation, given his age and life expectancy.",
  "Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with high thromboembolic risk who are not suited for long-term oral anticoagulation and who have adequate life expectancy (minimum >1 year) and quality of life to benefit from LAAC_2": "Description 2:\nA 78-year-old female patient, who is a long-term resident in a nursing home, has been diagnosed with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. She has a history of recurrent falls and immobility, which have made the long-term use of oral anticoagulants challenging. The patient's atrial fibrillation has been symptomatic, manifesting as episodes of palpitations, dizziness, and shortness of breath. These symptoms have significantly impacted her quality of life, with a reported dyspnea score of 5/10 during atrial fibrillation episodes. Given her frailty and mobility issues, the patient and her caregivers are seeking alternative management options to improve her quality of life and reduce the risk of thromboembolic events.",
  "Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with high thromboembolic risk who are not suited for long-term oral anticoagulation and who have adequate life expectancy (minimum >1 year) and quality of life to benefit from LAAC_3": "Description 3:\nA 75-year-old male patient, who is an avid traveler, presented with a history of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. He has had concerns about the long-term use of oral anticoagulants due to frequent international travel and the associated challenges of medication adherence.
