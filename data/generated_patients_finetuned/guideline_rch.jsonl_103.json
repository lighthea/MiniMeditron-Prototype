  "Cervical lymphadenopathy_1": "   Patient Description 1:\n   A 42-year-old male patient, a frequent traveler to regions with a high incidence of tuberculosis, presented with a neck lump that has been progressively growing in size over the last six weeks. The lump, located in the right anterior cervical region, is approximately 3 cm in diameter, firm, and non-tender. The patient denied any history of fever, night sweats, or weight loss. There is no restriction in neck movement. However, the patient reported a viral prodrome preceding the appearance of the neck lump. Notably, he has a past medical history of dental caries. Initial antibiotic treatment showed no significant change in the lump's characteristics. Given the patient's travel history, the presence of a viral prodrome, and the specific location and nature of the neck lump, a comprehensive evaluation is warranted to determine the underlying etiology.",
  "Cervical lymphadenopathy_2": "   Patient Description 2:\n   A 30-year-old female patient, with a history of frequent contact with cats, presented with a two-month history of a painless neck lump on the left side. The lump, located in the posterior cervical region, measures approximately 2.5 cm in diameter and is described as soft and mobile. The patient denied any fever, night sweats, or weight loss. There are no overlying skin changes or restrictions in neck movement. However, the presence of an associated history of exposure to cats is notable. The patient's immunization status is up to date. Given the patient's contact with animals, the specific features of the neck lump, and the absence of systemic symptoms, an in-depth assessment is crucial to determine the nature of the condition.",
  "Cervical lymphadenopathy_3": "   Patient Description 3:\n   A 50-year-old male patient, with a remote history of overseas travel, presented with a one-month history of a rapidly enlarging, tender neck lump on the right side, measuring 4 cm in diameter. The patient reported a fever, night sweats, and a 5 kg unintentional weight loss over the past few weeks. The lump is warm, erythematous, and shows overlying skin changes. There is also restriction in neck movement, along with the presence of lymphadenopathy noted in the inguinal region. The patient denied any history of animal exposure but recalled a distant overseas travel. The constitutional symptoms, along with the specific characteristics of the tender, rapidly growing neck lump, necessitate urgent evaluation to identify the underlying condition, given the patient's travel history and the presence of a viral prodrome."
