  "Bleeding Disorder Patients Undergoing GI Endoscopy_1": "    Description 1:\n    A 45-year-old male patient, known to have a moderate bleeding disorder, presented with a history of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding. He described his current episode as moderately severe, with an estimated blood loss of 200 mL over the past week, resulting in melena and associated fatigue. The patient is not on prophylaxis for his bleeding disorder. Given the severity of his bleeding disorder and the presence of ongoing GI bleeding, a comprehensive evaluation with GI endoscopy is warranted to identify the size and type of the lesion contributing to his symptoms.",
  "Bleeding Disorder Patients Undergoing GI Endoscopy_2": "    Description 2:\n    A 55-year-old female patient with a diagnosed mild bleeding disorder reported to the clinic with a history of intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding. She described her current episode as mild, with occasional episodes of blood in her stools. The patient has not been on prophylactic treatment for her bleeding disorder. In this context, the diagnostic approach, including GI endoscopy, needs to consider the type and severity of the patient's bleeding disorder to determine the underlying cause of her gastrointestinal bleeding and the nature of any associated lesions.",
  "Bleeding Disorder Patients Undergoing GI Endoscopy_3": "    Description 3:\n    A 60-year-old male patient, known to have a severe bleeding disorder, presented with a recent episode of acute and severe gastrointestinal bleeding. He reported a significant blood loss, estimated at 500 mL over the past 3 days, leading to hematochezia and dizziness. The patient is on prophylaxis for his bleeding disorder, but the current bleeding episode is beyond his baseline symptoms. Given the severity of his bleeding disorder and the acute nature of the GI bleed, an urgent GI endoscopy is essential to assess the size and type of the lesion causing the profuse gastrointestinal bleeding. This evaluation is crucial to guide appropriate management in the context of the patient's known bleeding disorder."
