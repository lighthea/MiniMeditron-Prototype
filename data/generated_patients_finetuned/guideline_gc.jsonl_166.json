  "Acute Headache_1": "   Patient Description 1:\n   A 36-year-old female patient, with a history of migraines, presented with a sudden, severe thunderclap headache, which she described as the worst headache of her life, reaching a peak within 1 hour of onset. She also reported neck pain and stiffness, as well as limited neck flexion. The patient's neurological examination revealed normal results. Although she had experienced witnessed loss of consciousness during the episode, there was no history of head trauma. Given her atypical presentation and the risk factors for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), such as the thunderclap headache and the witnessed loss of consciousness, further evaluation is warranted.",
  "Acute Headache_2": "   Patient Description 2:\n   A 45-year-old male patient, previously healthy, presented with a sudden, severe headache that he experienced during exertion. He described the headache as \"explosive\" and reported neck pain and stiffness, which were exacerbated with neck flexion. The onset of the headache was associated with exertion, and it reached its peak severity within 1 hour. The patient's neurological examination revealed normal findings. There was no witnessed loss of consciousness or history of head trauma. Given the history of exertional onset, along with the associated neck pain and stiffness, as well as the rapid peak in severity, further evaluation is crucial to determine the underlying cause of his symptoms.",
  "Acute Headache_3": "   Patient Description 3:\n   A 50-year-old female patient, known for hypertension, presented with a sudden, severe thunderclap headache that reached its peak intensity within 1 hour of onset. She reported neck pain, stiffness, and limited neck flexion, along with a history of witnessed loss of consciousness during the headache episode. The patient's neurological examination was unremarkable. She had no previous head trauma. Considering her hypertensive condition and the witnessed loss of consciousness, the patient is at an increased risk for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Further evaluation is essential, given the potential implications of her symptoms and risk factors."
