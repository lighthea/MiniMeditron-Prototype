The pain is localized to the cervical region and is exacerbated by movement. He also reported neurological deficits, including bilateral upper and lower limb weakness, as well as a tingling sensation (rated 7/10) in both hands and feet. On examination, the patient exhibited signs of paralysis and loss of sensation below the level of the cervical injury. There is also a notable difficulty in breathing and coughing. The patient's loss of bowel and bladder control further complicates the clinical presentation. Diagnostic evaluation is essential to determine the level and extent of the spinal cord injury and guide appropriate management.",
