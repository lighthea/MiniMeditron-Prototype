  "Eosinophilic Esophagitis_1": " 1. A 35-year-old male patient, with a known history of allergies and asthma, presented with a complex set of symptoms. The patient reported a persistent sensation of food getting stuck in his esophagus after swallowing, accompanied by frequent episodes of difficulty swallowing, which he rates at 7/10 on the pain scale. He described chest pain that has been unresponsive to over-the-counter antacids. Additionally, the patient experienced intermittent backflow of undigested food and occasional vomiting. Despite being on a regimen of GERD medication for three months, his symptoms have not improved. There is no family history of similar complaints. Further evaluation is warranted to determine the underlying cause of his esophageal dysfunction.",
  "Eosinophilic Esophagitis_2": "2. An 8-year-old female patient, with a history of seasonal allergies, was brought in by her parents due to concerning symptoms. The child has been experiencing difficulty eating, consistently refusing certain foods, and reporting a sensation of food \"sticking\" in her throat, associated with mild chest pain (3/10 on the pain scale). She has also complained of abdominal pain and occasional vomiting. The parents noted that their daughter's growth and weight gain have been below the expected levels for her age, raising concerns about failure to thrive. There is no significant family history of gastrointestinal disorders. Given the unresponsiveness to dietary modifications and basic acid reflux treatments, a comprehensive diagnostic approach is necessary to elucidate the nature of her persistent symptoms.",
  "Eosinophilic Esophagitis_3": "3. A 6-month-old male infant was brought in by his parents, who were worried about his feeding difficulties. The infant has been showing signs of distress during feeding, often refusing to eat, and displaying recurrent episodes of vomiting. The parents reported that the child's feeding challenges have led to poor weight gain and developmental concerns, indicative of failure to thrive. There is no family history of similar issues. Despite multiple formula changes and feeding modifications, the infant's symptoms persist. A thorough evaluation is essential to determine the underlying cause of his feeding problems and to guide appropriate management."
