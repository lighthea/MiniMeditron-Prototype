  "Kawasaki disease_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 3-year-old male child, with no significant medical history, is presented with a persistent fever consistently at 104.5 F (40.3 C) for the past seven days, which has been unresponsive to antipyretic medications. The fever is accompanied by a diffuse rash over the entire body, an enlarged lymph node in the neck, and extremely red eyes without purulent discharge. The child has been irritable and has experienced abdominal pain and diarrhea. There is a notable presence of joint pain, and the parents reported episodes of vomiting. These symptoms collectively raise concerns for Kawasaki disease, especially given the prolonged high fever and the constellation of characteristic clinical manifestations. Further evaluation is warranted to confirm the diagnosis and initiate prompt management.",
  "Kawasaki disease_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 19-month-old female toddler, without prior significant medical history, is brought in by her parents due to a febrile illness. The child has been running a persistent high-grade fever of 103.8 F (39.9 C) for the last six days. In addition to the fever, she has developed a rash on the trunk and genital area. Her parents have observed extremely red, cracked lips, and her tongue appears markedly swollen and red. The toddler also exhibits irritability and has been experiencing abdominal pain, along with episodes of vomiting and diarrhea. Upon examination, the presence of swollen, red skin on the palms of her hands and the soles of her feet is noted. Given the protracted fever and the combination of clinical signs, there is a strong suspicion of Kawasaki disease. Further diagnostic workup is essential to confirm the condition and institute appropriate management.",
  "Kawasaki disease_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 5-year-old male child, with no significant medical history, is assessed for a prolonged febrile illness. The fever has persisted at 102.6 F (39.2 C) for the past six days, and the child has now developed a diffuse rash on his body, along with red, dry, cracked lips and an extremely red, swollen tongue. He also exhibits irritability and abdominal pain and has been experiencing joint pain. Although there is no vomiting, the presence of diarrhea is notable. The combination of fever, rash, and mucocutaneous changes, along with other associated symptoms, raises concerns for Kawasaki disease. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is necessary to confirm the diagnosis, given the atypical presentation and the presence of fewer classical signs, as seen in incomplete Kawasaki disease."
