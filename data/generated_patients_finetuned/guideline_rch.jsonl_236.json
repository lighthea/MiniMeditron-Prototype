  "Nephrotic Syndrome_1": "    Patient A, a 6-year-old child, presents with a complex set of symptoms. The prominent clinical feature is generalized edema, including periorbital edema, which the patient and parents have noticed for the past three weeks. The child's abdominal cramps have become increasingly severe, accompanied by dizziness and tachycardia. Notably, there is a history of reduced urine output, and the child is now experiencing peripheral hypoperfusion, as evidenced by cold hands and feet. The presence of hypoalbuminemia is confirmed, and the patient's medical history is unremarkable. However, the constellation of symptoms, including the gross limb edema with a potential for skin breakdown, raises concern. Further diagnostic investigation is warranted, considering the age of the patient and the systemic nature of the presentation.",
  "Nephrotic Syndrome_2": "    Patient B, a 28-year-old woman, seeks medical attention for an escalating health issue. She reports a three-week history of generalized edema, including noticeable periorbital edema. The patient describes abdominal cramps, accompanied by dizziness and tachycardia, which have been distressing. Notably, she has gross vulval edema, adding to her discomfort. The presence of proteinuria is confirmed, and the patient has no significant medical history. The ongoing symptoms, along with the vulval edema and abdominal discomfort, necessitate a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to determine the underlying cause of her condition.",
  "Nephrotic Syndrome_3": "    Patient C, a 45-year-old man, presents with a concerning medical picture. He reports a four-week history of generalized edema, including periorbital edema, along with abdominal cramps and dizziness. The patient's discomfort is further compounded by gross scrotal edema. Laboratory tests confirm hypoalbuminemia and proteinuria. The absence of a notable medical history is recorded. The combination of symptoms, including the gross scrotal edema, raises the urgency for diagnostic assessment to elucidate the underlying etiology of his condition."
