  "Retropharyngeal abscess_1": "    Patient A, a 6-year-old male, presents with a persistent neck pain rated at 7/10, which has been escalating over the past week. The discomfort is exacerbated by neck flexion. Notably, the patient has a history of recurrent upper respiratory infections and recent episodes of fever. Physical examination reveals a widened prevertebral shadow on imaging studies. Clinical suspicion for a retropharyngeal abscess is high, given the constellation of symptoms, the presence of a widened prevertebral shadow, and the patient's medical history.",
  "Retropharyngeal abscess_2": "    Patient B, a 28-year-old otherwise healthy female, seeks medical attention for a progressively worsening neck pain, which she describes as 8/10 in intensity. The pain is exacerbated when she flexes her neck. The patient reports a recent upper respiratory tract infection. There is a noticeable widened prevertebral shadow observed on imaging studies. Clinical suspicion for a retropharyngeal abscess is heightened, considering the neck pain, history of respiratory infection, and the radiographic finding of a widened prevertebral shadow.",
  "Retropharyngeal abscess_3": "    Patient C, a 42-year-old male, with a history of tobacco use, presents with a persistent neck pain rated at 6/10, which has been worsening over the past two weeks. The pain is notably exacerbated by neck flexion. The patient reports a recent upper respiratory infection and a low-grade fever. Imaging studies reveal a widened prevertebral shadow. Given the clinical presentation, history of tobacco use, and the radiographic finding, there is a high clinical suspicion for a retropharyngeal abscess."
