  "Cardiac Dysfunction in Survivors of Adult Cancers_1": " 1. A 55-year-old female patient, with a history of breast cancer, presented with borderline low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 50%. The patient's medical history revealed the use of high-dose anthracycline in her cancer treatment. Additionally, she has a moderate valvular heart disease. The contextual information of her lower LVEF, history of myocardial infarction, and exposure to high-dose anthracycline align with the cardiac dysfunction commonly observed in survivors of adult cancers. It is crucial to monitor her cardiac function closely due to the potential impact of her cancer treatment on the heart.",
  "Cardiac Dysfunction in Survivors of Adult Cancers_2": "2. A 60-year-old male patient, with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, presented with a borderline low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 52%. The patient's cancer treatment involved a combination of lower-dose anthracycline and radiotherapy affecting the heart. He also has a history of myocardial infarction. These factors, along with his compromised cardiac function, are indicative of cardiac dysfunction in survivors of adult cancers. Close monitoring and a comprehensive assessment of his cardiac health are essential in managing his condition.",
  "Cardiac Dysfunction in Survivors of Adult Cancers_3": "3. A 65-year-old male patient, who underwent treatment for prostate cancer, exhibited a borderline low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 50%. His cancer treatment included lower-dose anthracycline in combination with lower-dose radiotherapy that targeted the heart. The patient's older age at the time of cancer treatment, coupled with multiple cardiovascular risk factors, further complicates his cardiac health. This clinical presentation aligns with the cardiac dysfunction observed in survivors of adult cancers, emphasizing the need for a proactive approach to cardiac monitoring and management in this patient population."
