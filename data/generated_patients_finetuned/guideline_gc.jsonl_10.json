  "Upper Extremity Amputation Rehabilitation_1": " 1. A 45-year-old male patient with a history of occupational machinery accidents presented with a challenging upper extremity amputation rehabilitation case. The patient's residual limb exhibits persistent phantom limb pain, rated at 7/10 on the pain scale, which significantly hampers his daily activities and sleep patterns. Despite previous trials of standard pain management techniques, including pharmacotherapy and physical therapy, the phantom limb pain remains inadequately controlled. Additionally, the patient experiences protracted and frustrating difficulties in adapting to prosthesis use, with reported episodes of skin irritation and difficulty in achieving optimal functional performance. His occupational demand for manual dexterity further complicates his rehabilitation process. A comprehensive assessment is warranted to address the complex pain management, prosthesis fitting, and functional rehabilitation needs in this case.",
  "Upper Extremity Amputation Rehabilitation_2": "2. A 55-year-old female patient, post-upper extremity limb amputation following a traumatic injury, seeks rehabilitation intervention for her persistent symptoms. The patient endures recurrent episodes of residual limb pain, characterized by a burning sensation and rated at 6/10 in intensity, which escalates during prosthesis wear and activities requiring upper body movement. This pain has led to a notable decline in the patient's quality of life and functional independence. Furthermore, she reports ongoing challenges in adapting to prosthesis use, citing difficulties in achieving a secure fit, as well as reduced range of motion and strength in the remaining upper limb. Despite prior attempts at physical therapy, the patient's prosthetic concerns and pain persist, necessitating a comprehensive re-evaluation of her rehabilitation plan.",
  "Upper Extremity Amputation Rehabilitation_3": "3. A 30-year-old male patient, with a history of upper extremity amputation due to a work-related injury, presents with a complex rehabilitation scenario. The patient experiences chronic and severe phantom limb pain, with a consistent pain rating of 8/10, significantly impacting his daily activities and psychological well-being. He describes his pain as stabbing and shooting, often triggered by changes in weather and emotional stress. Despite trialing various pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain management strategies, the pain remains refractory. Additionally, the patient encounters substantial difficulties in prosthesis utilization, reporting persistent issues with fit, function, and skin breakdown. These challenges are further complicated by the patient's vocational requirements, which demand robust upper limb functionality. A multidisciplinary approach is imperative to address the patient's complex pain presentation, enhance his prosthetic adaptation, and optimize his functional outcomes."
