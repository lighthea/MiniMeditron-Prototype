  "Non-ampullary duodenal lesions_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 57-year-old male, with a history of chronic gastritis and long-term nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use for arthritis, presented with persistent, dull epigastric pain (rated at 4/10) that worsened after meals. His discomfort is often accompanied by nausea and occasional vomiting, and he reports a notable decrease in appetite, leading to a weight loss of 8 pounds over the last three months. Physical examination revealed mild pallor. Given the patient's risk factors and the constellation of symptoms, further evaluation is crucial to determine the nature of the non-ampullary duodenal lesion and to guide appropriate management.",
  "Non-ampullary duodenal lesions_2": "Patient Description 2:\nA 45-year-old female, without significant past medical history, reported recurrent, crampy abdominal pain in the epigastric region, which she described as moderate to severe in intensity (6-8/10). The pain is associated with nausea and vomiting, occurring at least three times a week. The patient has also experienced a progressive loss of appetite and a substantial unintentional weight loss of 15 pounds over the last two months. These concerning symptoms prompted her to seek medical attention. Given the severity of her clinical presentation and the presence of anaemia, an urgent assessment is necessary to explore the non-ampullary duodenal lesion and implement an appropriate treatment plan.",
  "Non-ampullary duodenal lesions_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 61-year-old male, with a history of peptic ulcer disease, presented with chronic, gnawing epigastric pain (rated at 3/10) and recurrent episodes of nausea and vomiting. He reported a gradual loss of appetite and a weight reduction of 10 pounds over the past four months. The patient's physical examination was notable for mild anaemia. Despite being on proton pump inhibitor therapy for his peptic ulcer disease, his symptoms have persisted. Given the recurrent nature of his abdominal pain, the history of peptic ulcer disease, and the presence of anaemia, a comprehensive assessment is essential to elucidate the nature of the non-ampullary duodenal lesion and determine the most appropriate course of action."
