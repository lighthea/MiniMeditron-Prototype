  "untreated non-small-cell lung cancer_1": "Patient Description 1:\nA 58-year-old male with a 30 pack-year smoking history presented with a persistent, non-productive cough, which he has been experiencing for the past six months. The cough is often accompanied by mild hemoptysis, and the patient has reported a gradual but noticeable weight loss of 12 pounds over the last three months despite maintaining his regular diet. He has a history of occupational asbestos exposure. Physical examination revealed decreased breath sounds in the right lower lung field. Imaging studies confirmed the presence of a large, centrally located lung mass. The patient has not undergone any previous treatment for these symptoms. It is important to note that the potential for curative surgery or radiation therapy is currently deemed unsuitable for this case.",

She described the cough as productive, yielding occasional blood-tinged sputum. The patient reported a chronic dull chest pain, localized to the right side, with a severity score of 5/10. She also experienced unexplained fatigue and unintentional weight loss of 15 pounds over the last four months. Physical examination revealed decreased breath sounds in the right upper lung. Imaging studies identified a sizable mass in the right lung. The patient has no previous history of lung-related treatments. Notably, the potential for curative surgery or radiation therapy is currently considered unsuitable in this case.",
  "untreated non-small-cell lung cancer_3": "Patient Description 3:\nA 70-year-old male, lifelong non-smoker, presented with a persistent cough that has been ongoing for the past nine months. The cough is non-productive, but the patient reported a gradually increasing severity, which he now rates at 4/10. He denied any hemoptysis but endorsed a persistent hoarseness of voice. Additionally, the patient experienced chest discomfort, characterized as a dull pain with a severity score of 3/10. Physical examination indicated reduced breath sounds in the left lower lung field. Imaging studies revealed a substantial mass in the left lung. The patient has no history of lung-related treatments. It is important to highlight that, given the current clinical context, potentially curative surgery or radiation therapy is deemed unsuitable for this case."
