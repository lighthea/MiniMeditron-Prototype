  "Colorectal carcinoma_1": "    Patient A, a 55-year-old male with a family history of colorectal carcinoma, presented with persistent changes in bowel habits, including increased stool frequency and a sensation of incomplete evacuation. He reported intermittent abdominal pain, rated at 4/10 in severity, and unintentional weight loss of 10 pounds over the past three months. Despite dietary modifications, his symptoms have persisted for the last six weeks. Physical examination revealed mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. Given the patient's age, familial predisposition, and the presence of concerning gastrointestinal symptoms, further evaluation, including RAS mutational testing, BRAF p.V600 mutational analysis, and loss of MLH1 assessment, is warranted to determine the etiology of his condition and guide appropriate management.",
  "Colorectal carcinoma_2": "    Patient B, a 60-year-old female, with a history of adenomatous polyps, presented with recurrent episodes of rectal bleeding, which she described as moderate, with a pain score of 3/10. The bleeding has been ongoing for the past four months and is often accompanied by a sense of rectal fullness. She also reported fatigue and a decreased exercise tolerance, which she attributed to her anemia. Despite iron supplementation, her hemoglobin levels have remained low. Digital rectal examination revealed a palpable mass in the rectum. Given the patient's history of adenomatous polyps, her current symptoms, and the identified rectal mass, a comprehensive evaluation, including MMR status testing, PIK3CA mutational analysis, and PTEN analysis, is crucial to establish a diagnosis and determine the extent of the disease.",
  "Colorectal carcinoma_3": "    Patient C, a 65-year-old male, presented with recurrent, severe crampy abdominal pain, localized to the right lower quadrant, with a pain score of 8/10. He reported a change in bowel habits, including constipation alternating with episodes of diarrhea, as well as a sensation of bloating. These symptoms have persisted for six months, leading to a noticeable decline in his quality of life. Physical examination revealed tenderness and palpable resistance in the right lower quadrant. The patient had no prior history of gastrointestinal conditions. Given the persistent, severe abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, and physical examination findings, further diagnostic workup, including evaluation for metastatic or recurrent colorectal carcinoma, is essential. This should encompass RAS mutational testing, BRAF p.V600 mutational analysis, and a comprehensive assessment of MMR status, as indicated in the contextual information. These tests are crucial for accurately diagnosing the patient's condition and devising an appropriate management plan."
