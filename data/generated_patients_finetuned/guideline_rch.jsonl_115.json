  "Excessive crying in infants_1": "   Patient A is a 6-week-old infant presenting with excessive crying, which persists for several hours each day. The crying episodes notably intensify during the late afternoon and evening. Additionally, the infant often draws up their legs as if in pain, and there are sudden onset bouts of irritability and crying. The mother has a history of post-natal depression, adding a contextual factor that may influence the diagnostic process. The infant's medical history is unremarkable, and no previous treatments have been administered.",
  "Excessive crying in infants_2": "   Patient B, a 2-month-old infant, exhibits excessive crying, lasting for extended periods throughout the day. The crying becomes notably more intense in the late afternoon and evening. Furthermore, the infant frequently draws up their legs in a manner suggestive of pain, and sudden episodes of irritability and crying are observed. There is no significant parental post-natal depression in the family, and the mother's mental health is stable. The infant has no prior medical history, and no treatments have been initiated.",
  "Excessive crying in infants_3": "   Patient C, a 7-week-old infant, displays a pattern of excessive crying, persisting for several hours daily, with heightened episodes in the late afternoon and evening. The infant often draws up their legs, resembling a response to pain, and exhibits sudden onset irritability and crying. The family history is negative for parental post-natal depression. However, there is a notable risk factor for abusive head trauma (shaken baby syndrome) in the family, which may influence the diagnostic approach. The infant has no significant medical history, and no prior treatments have been administered."
