  "Multiple Myeloma_1": "    Patient A, a 58-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, presents with a relapse of the disease following an initial autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (auto-HCT). The patient exhibits high-risk cytogenetics, specifically the t(4:14) translocation, and is experiencing persistent cytopenias, particularly anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL. Despite the previous treatment, the disease has shown refractory behavior, and the patient's renal function is deteriorating, as evidenced by rising creatinine levels. Additionally, the presence of adverse chromosome changes further complicates the case. The HCT-CI score is greater than 2, and the patient's Karnofsky performance status is below 90. These factors pose challenges in managing the relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma in this individual.",
  "Multiple Myeloma_2": "    Patient B, a 64-year-old female, is being evaluated for suspected multiple myeloma. She presents with oligosecretory plasma cell disorder, characterized by low levels of M-protein secretion, making the disease challenging to monitor. The patient has persistent cytopenias, with a white blood cell count of 3.5 x 10^9/L and a platelet count of 90 x 10^9/L. Despite the absence of a measurable M-protein spike in the serum or urine, the clinical suspicion for multiple myeloma remains high due to the combination of oligosecretory disease and persistent cytopenias. Diagnostic evaluation is further complicated by the need for minimal residual disease (MRD) testing after auto-HCT, as this patient has undergone a prior hematopoietic cell transplantation.",
  "Multiple Myeloma_3": "    Patient C, a 72-year-old male, is referred for the management of very high-risk multiple myeloma. He has a history of the disease and has relapsed with aggressive features, including the del17p cytogenetic abnormality. The patient's myeloma has shown rapid progression, and he exhibits a markedly elevated beta-2 microglobulin level of 7.0 mg/L. Renal failure is evident, with a creatinine clearance of 40 mL/min, further complicating the clinical picture. Given the relapse and progression of the disease after prior HCT, as well as the presence of very high-risk features, the management of this patient's multiple myeloma poses considerable challenges. The adverse clinical and cytogenetic factors underscore the aggressive nature of the disease in this individual.\n"
