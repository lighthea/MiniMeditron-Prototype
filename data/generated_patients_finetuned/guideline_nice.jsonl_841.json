  "metastatic colorectal cancer_1": "1.  A 57-year-old male patient presented with persistent, dull abdominal discomfort, localized in the lower right quadrant, which he rated at 4/10 on the pain scale. The pain has been ongoing for the past six months, and the patient has noticed a significant unintentional weight loss of 15 pounds during this period. He has no history of inflammatory bowel disease or familial gastrointestinal malignancies. The diagnostic workup, including colonoscopy and imaging studies, was prompted by the concerning clinical presentation. The patient's symptoms, in conjunction with the evidence submission from the manufacturer, have raised valid concerns regarding the presence of an underlying condition that warrants further evaluation.",
  "metastatic colorectal cancer_2": "2.  A 64-year-old female patient, with a family history of colorectal cancer, reported frequently recurring episodes of rectal bleeding, accompanied by intermittent abdominal cramping pain rated at 6/10 in severity. The pain has been progressively worsening over the last three months. Despite prior episodes of hemorrhoids, the intensity and persistence of her current symptoms have led to the consideration of an alternative etiology. The patient's family history further raises the index of suspicion for underlying colorectal pathology. Given the presence of these symptoms and the documented evidence submission, a comprehensive diagnostic assessment is imperative to determine the nature of her condition.",
  "metastatic colorectal cancer_3": "3.  A 49-year-old male patient, previously diagnosed with colon adenomas and a history of resective surgery for non-malignant colorectal polyps, presented with a complex symptomatology. He reported recurrent episodes of bright red blood in his stool, along with a persistent, crampy abdominal pain that he rated at 5/10 in intensity. The pain has been present for the past four months and is not alleviated by over-the-counter medications. The patient's notable medical history, including the previous colon pathology and surgical intervention, adds a layer of complexity to his current clinical presentation. In light of the documented evidence submission, further diagnostic investigations are warranted to elucidate the underlying cause of his symptoms and assess the possibility of disease recurrence."
