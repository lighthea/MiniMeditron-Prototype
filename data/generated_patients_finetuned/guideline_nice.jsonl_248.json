  "Trigeminal neuralgia_1": "    Patient Description 1:\n    A 52-year-old female patient with a history of multiple sclerosis presented with paroxysms of sudden, electric-shock-like, severe facial pain, predominantly localized to the right side of her face. She described the pain episodes as debilitating, with a rating of 9/10 on the pain scale, often triggered by light touch or specific facial movements. Additionally, the patient reported aching and burning sensations in the same area during the pain-free intervals. Given the coexistence of multiple sclerosis, the diagnostic approach should carefully differentiate between typical and atypical trigeminal neuralgia.",
  "Trigeminal neuralgia_2": "    Patient Description 2:\n    A 64-year-old male patient, with a known medical history of hypertension, presented with recurrent episodes of excruciating facial pain, characterized as sudden, stabbing, and severe, mainly affecting the right side of his face. The pain, rated at 10/10 in intensity, was often triggered by routine activities such as eating, talking, or even slight facial movements. Alongside these acute episodes, the patient also reported a continuous, lower intensity aching sensation in the same facial region. It is vital to consider the potential impact of vascular compression due to the patient's hypertension in the diagnostic evaluation.",
  "Trigeminal neuralgia_3": "    Patient Description 3:\n    A 45-year-old female patient without a known medical history reported episodes of severe facial pain, described as sudden, electric-shock-like, and localized to the left side of her face. The pain, rated at 8/10, occurred spontaneously or with trivial stimuli like talking or chewing. In addition to the intense paroxysms, the patient experienced a persistent burning sensation and aching pain of lower intensity in the affected area. Given the absence of prior medical conditions, the diagnostic workup should focus on distinguishing between idiopathic and secondary trigeminal neuralgia, considering the possibility of an underlying etiology."
