**Main Subject:** Allergic Rhinitis (AR) Diagnosis and Management

**Use Cases:**

- **Indications for Treatment:**
  1. **Clinical Diagnosis:** The diagnosis of allergic rhinitis should be made based on consistent history and physical findings, such as clear rhinorrhea, pale discoloration of nasal mucosa, and red and watery eyes, along with symptoms like nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy nose, or sneezing.
  2. **Assessment for Associated Conditions:** Individuals diagnosed with AR should be assessed for associated conditions like asthma, atopic dermatitis, sleep-disordered breathing, conjunctivitis, rhinosinusitis, and otitis media.
  3. **Specific IgE Testing:** Testing (blood or skin) should be performed for patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR who do not respond to empiric treatment, when the diagnosis is uncertain, or when determination of specific target allergen is needed.
  4. **Symptomatic Relief:** Intranasal steroids should be prescribed for patients with AR whose symptoms affect their quality of life.
  5. **Primary Complaints of Sneezing and Itching:** Oral second-generation/less sedating antihistamines are recommended for patients with AR and primary complaints of sneezing and itching.
  6. **Inadequate Response to Monotherapy:** Combination pharmacologic therapy, specifically intranasal steroid and intranasal antihistamine, may be prescribed for patients with AR who have an inadequate response to monotherapy.
  7. **Immunotherapy:** Immunotherapy should be prescribed for patients with AR who do not respond well to pharmacologic therapy.
  8. **Nasal Airway Obstruction:** Inferior turbinate reduction may be considered for patients with AR experiencing nasal airway obstruction and enlarged inferior turbinates who have failed medical management.

- **Counter-Indications for Treatment:**
  1. **Routine Sinonasal Imaging:** Sinonasal imaging should not be routinely performed in patients presenting with symptoms consistent with allergic rhinitis.
  2. **Primary Therapy with Oral Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists:** Oral leukotriene receptor antagonists should not be prescribed as primary therapy for patients with AR.
  3. **Avoidance of Allergens:** Avoidance of known allergens or environmental control may be considered but is not explicitly indicated for all patients. This decision depends on individual patient circumstances.

**Additional Information:**
The provided information does not specify additional details beyond the mentioned indications, counter-indications, and management strategies for allergic rhinitis. For a comprehensive understanding, it is recommended to refer to the full recommendation, including the treatment flow chart and specific pharmacologic options, for a more detailed overview of the management guidelines.

**Main Subject:** Acute and Chronic Rhinosinusitis Diagnosis and Management

**Use Cases:**

- **Indications for Treatment:**
  1. **Distinguishing ABRS from Viral Rhinosinusitis:** ABRS should be diagnosed when signs and symptoms of acute rhinosinusitis (purulent nasal drainage plus nasal obstruction, facial pain-pressure or both) persist without improvement for at least 10 days or if symptoms worsen within 10 days after initial improvement, distinguishing it from viral rhinosinusitis.
  2. **Symptomatic Relief:** Analgesics, intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation can be recommended for symptomatic relief of viral or bacterial rhinosinusitis.
  3. **Uncomplicated ABRS Treatment Options:**
     - Adults with uncomplicated ABRS can be offered watchful waiting or prescribed antibiotic therapy. Antibiotics are recommended if symptoms fail to improve after 7 days or worsen at any time during the watchful waiting period.
     - First-line antibiotic therapy for ABRS is amoxicillin with or without clavulanate for 5-10 days. Amoxicillin with clavulanate should be prescribed for patients at high risk of antibiotic-resistant infections.
     - Patients allergic to penicillin should be prescribed doxycycline or a respiratory quinolone as first-line therapy.
     - Reassessment is necessary if there is no improvement or worsening by 7 days. If initial treatment was watchful waiting, antibiotics should be prescribed. If antibiotics were initially prescribed, a different antibiotic should be prescribed if there is no improvement.
  4. **Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) Management:**
     - CRS diagnosis should be confirmed with documentation of sinonasal inflammation using anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy, or computed tomography.
     - Saline nasal irrigation, intranasal corticosteroids, or both should be prescribed for symptom relief in patients with CRS.
     - Testing for allergy and immune function may be obtained when evaluating patients with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis.

- **Counter-Indications for Treatment:**
  1. **Radiographic Imaging for ARS:** Radiographic imaging should not be performed in patients with acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) unless complications or alternative diagnoses are suspected.

**Additional Information:**
The provided information outlines the criteria for diagnosing acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) and emphasizes the importance of distinguishing it from viral rhinosinusitis. It also provides guidelines for the use of antibiotics, symptomatic relief methods, and management options for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Additionally, it advises against routine radiographic imaging for ARS unless complications or alternative diagnoses are suspected. For further details, it is recommended to refer to the full recommendation, which may contain additional specifics and guidelines regarding the management of rhinosinusitis.
