Example of a CCO report :

**Main Subject:** Diagnosis, Staging, Recurrence, and Restaging of Head and Neck Cancer using PET and PET/CT Imaging.

**Population Target:** Patients with head and neck cancer.

**Diagnosis:**
- **Use Cases:**
  1. **Primary Tumor Delineation and Nodal Staging:** PET is recommended in cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma where conventional imaging results are equivocal or where treatment modifications are possible. It significantly improves primary tumor delineation and nodal staging, leading to changes in clinical management. PET/CT is particularly beneficial in these cases, as it offers detailed anatomical and functional information.
  2. **Detection of Unknown Primary Tumors:** PET is recommended after conventional imaging and before diagnostic panendoscopy when the primary site is unknown. It is effective in detecting 30% of primary tumors, including those missed by conventional imaging. PET/CT is especially valuable in these situations, aiding in treatment planning.
  3. **Staging and Assessment of Recurrence in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma:** PET is recommended for staging and assessing recurrence in nasopharyngeal carcinoma when conventional imaging results are equivocal. It provides additional information for accurate staging and management decisions.

- **Usefulness for Distant Diseases:**
  - PET imaging is valuable in detecting distant metastatic disease, especially in patients at high risk, such as those with locally advanced disease and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. It outperforms conventional imaging in detecting distant metastases, although there are false-positive rates to consider, particularly in low-risk patients.

- **Usefulness for Recurrent Diseases:**
  - **Larynx:** There is moderate evidence that PET is beneficial in detecting recurrent disease in the larynx. It also reduces the need for invasive laryngeal biopsies, offering a less debilitating diagnostic option.
  - **Neck Lymphadenopathy after Radiation or Chemoradiation:** PET-directed management of the neck after therapy helps spare unnecessary neck dissections in patients with PET-negative residual CT abnormalities. It is particularly useful for assessing areas that are not clinically accessible or difficult to examine.

**Counter-indications:** The report does not provide specific counter-indications, but it emphasizes the limitations of PET in the clinically N-0 neck, where it does not appear to be superior to conventional imaging due to a high false-negative rate.

**Additional Information:** The report does not specify any additional information beyond the provided details on the use cases, effectiveness, and limitations of PET and PET/CT imaging in head and neck cancer diagnosis, staging, and recurrence assessment.

Example of a CCO report :

**Main Subject:** Clinical Utility of Multigene Profiling Assays in Early-Stage Invasive Breast Cancer.

**Population Target:** Individuals diagnosed with early-stage invasive breast cancer (defined as stage I to III, surgically operable, and without evidence of inflammatory, locally recurrent, or distant metastatic disease, with pT1-T3, pN0-N1a based on surgical pathologic staging).

**Diagnosis:**
- **Use Cases:**
  1. **Guiding Systemic Therapy:** Multigene profiling assays (e.g., Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, Prosigna, EndoPredict, and Breast Cancer Index) should be considered for patients with early-stage estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer to guide the use of systemic therapy. These assays provide molecular information that aids in treatment decision-making.

- **Usefulness for Distant Diseases:** The provided information does not specify the usefulness of multigene profiling assays for distant diseases.

- **Usefulness for Recurrent Diseases:**
  - **Duration of Endocrine Therapy:** In patients with ER-positive disease, clinicians may consider using a Breast Cancer Index (BCI) (H/I) high assay result to support a decision to extend adjuvant endocrine therapy if the decision is supported by other clinical, pathological, or patient-related factors. The decision to extend therapy should be based on a combination of clinical and molecular information.

**Counter-indications:**
- **HER2-Positive or Triple Negative Breast Cancers:** There is insufficient evidence to use multigene profiling assays among patients with either HER2-positive or triple-negative breast cancers. These assays are specifically recommended for ER-positive/HER2-negative cases.
- **Multiple Assay Requests for a Single Treatment Decision:** Requesting multiple tests with different multigene profiling assays on an individual tumor specimen to guide a single treatment decision is discouraged. One multigene profiling assay should be used per patient to guide a specific treatment decision.
- **Interpretation in Premenopausal Patients:** Multigene profiling assays should be interpreted cautiously in premenopausal patients where a significant benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy may still exist despite a low-risk score. The report highlights uncertainties regarding the benefits of chemotherapy in premenopausal patients.
- **Limited Predictive Evidence for Certain Assays:** While assays like Prosigna, EndoPredict/EPclin, and Breast Cancer Index can identify low-risk node-positive patients with favorable prognostic outcomes, they have not demonstrated predictive evidence to support withholding adjuvant chemotherapy among higher risk, node-positive, ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer patients.

**Additional Information:** The report emphasizes the need for considering all available clinical and pathological information alongside multigene profiling assay results when making treatment decisions. It also notes the evolving nature of evidence, particularly regarding the use of molecular profiling to select the duration of endocrine therapy. The report does not provide specific details about the performance of these assays on particular cases.
