Health care providers might refer to this condition as an effusion (uh-FU-zhun) in your knee joint.\nA swollen knee may be the result of trauma, overuse injuries, or an underlying disease or condition. To find the cause of the swelling, your provider might need to test a sample of the fluid for infection, disease or blood from an injury.\nRemoving some of the fluid may help reduce the pain and stiffness associated with the swelling. Once the underlying cause is known, treatment can begin.\n\n# Symptoms\nSigns and symptoms typically include:\n- Swelling. The skin around your kneecap can puff up noticeably, especially when you compare the affected knee to your other one.\n- Stiffness. When your knee joint contains excess fluid, you might not be able to bend or straighten your leg completely.\n- Pain. Depending on the cause of the fluid buildup, your knee might be very painful \u2014 to the point that it's impossible to bear weight on it.\n\n# When to see a doctor\nSee your health care provider if self-care measures, such as ice and rest, don't improve symptoms. Seek immediate medical attention if one knee becomes red and feels warm to the touch compared with your other knee. This can be a sign of infection within the joint.\n\n# Causes\nMany types of problems, ranging from traumatic injuries to diseases and other conditions, can cause a swollen knee.\nDamage to any part of your knee can cause excess joint fluid to accumulate. Injuries that can cause fluid buildup in and around the knee joint include:\n- Torn ligament, particularly the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)\n- Cartilage (meniscus) tear\n- Irritation from overuse\n- Broken bones\nThe anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the key ligaments that help stabilize the knee joint. The  connects the thighbone (femur) to the shinbone (tibia). It's most commonly torn during sports that involve sudden stops and changes in direction\u00a0\u2014 such as basketball, soccer, tennis and volleyball.\nThe meniscus is a C-shaped piece of tough, rubbery cartilage that acts as a shock absorber between the shinbone and the thighbone. It can be torn if you suddenly twist your knee while bearing weight on it.\nUnderlying diseases and conditions that can produce fluid buildup in and around the knee joint include:\n- Osteoarthritis\n- Rheumatoid arthritis\n- Infection\n- Gout\n- Pseudogout\n- Bursitis\n- Cysts\n- Tumors\n\n# Risk factors\nFactors that may increase your risk of a swollen knee include:\n- Age. Your likelihood of developing a swollen knee related to arthritis increases as you age.\n- Sports. People who participate in sports that involve twisting the knee, such as basketball, are more likely to experience the types of knee injuries that cause swelling.\n- Obesity. Excess weight puts added stress on the knee joint, contributing to the tissue and joint overload and knee degeneration that can lead to a swollen knee.\n\n# Complications\nComplications of a swollen knee can include:\n- Muscle loss. Fluid in the knee can harm the working of your muscles and cause thigh muscles to weaken and atrophy.\n- Fluid-filled sac (Baker cyst). The buildup of fluid in your knee can lead to the formation of a Baker cyst in the back of your knee. A swollen Baker cyst can be painful, but usually improves with icing and compression. If the swelling is severe, you might need to have fluid removed with a needle.\n\n# Prevention\nA swollen knee is typically the result of an injury or chronic health condition. To manage your overall health and prevent injuries:\n- Strengthen the muscles around your knee. Strong muscles around a joint can help ease pressure on the joint itself.\n- Choose low-impact exercise. Certain activities, such as water aerobics and swimming, don't place continuous weight-bearing stress on your knee joints.\n- Maintain a healthy weight. Excess weight contributes to the wear-and-tear damage that can lead to a swollen knee.# Diagnosis & treatment\n\n# Diagnosis\nYour health care provider is likely to start with a detailed history and physical examination. After that you likely will need tests to find out what's causing your swollen knee.\nImaging tests can help show where the problem is located. Options include:\n- X-ray. An X-ray can rule out broken or dislocated bones and determine if you have arthritis.\n- Ultrasound. This test uses sound waves to check for disorders affecting the tendons or ligaments.\n- MRI. Using radio waves and a strong magnetic field, MRI can detect tendon, ligament and other soft tissue injuries that aren't visible on X-rays.\nA needle is used to remove fluid from inside your knee. This fluid is then checked for the presence of:\n- Blood, which may stem from injuries or bleeding disorders\n- Bacteria that may be causing an infection\n- Crystals common to gout or pseudogout\n\n# Treatment\nTreatment varies depending on the cause of the swollen knee, its severity and your medical history.\nPhysical therapy exercises can improve your knee's function and strength. In some situations, a knee brace may be helpful.\nTreating the underlying cause of a swollen knee might require:\n- Arthrocentesis. Removing fluid from the knee can help relieve pressure on the joint. After removing some of the joint fluid, your doctor might inject a corticosteroid into the joint to treat inflammation.\n- Arthroscopy. A lighted tube (arthroscope) is inserted through a small incision into your knee joint. Tools attached to the arthroscope can remove loose tissue or repair damage in your knee.\n\n# Self care\nTaking care of yourself when you have a swollen knee includes:\n- Rest. Avoid weight-bearing activities as much as possible.\n- Ice and elevation. To control pain and swelling, apply ice to your knee for 15 to 20 minutes every 2 to 4 hours. When you ice your knee, be sure to raise your knee higher than the level of your heart. Place pillows under your knee for comfort.\n- Compression. Wrapping your knee with an elastic bandage can help control the swelling.\n- Pain relievers. Over-the-counter medicines such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) can help reduce your knee pain.\n\n# Preparing for your appointment\nYou may be referred to a health care provider who specializes in musculoskeletal and joint problems.\n- Write down your symptoms, and when they began.\n- Write down your key medical information, including other conditions.\n- Write down key personal information, including any major changes or stressors in your life.\n- Make a list of all your medications, vitamins or supplements.\n- Find out if anyone in your family has had an autoimmune disease.\n- Ask a relative or friend to accompany you, to help you remember what the health care provider says.\n- Write down questions to ask the provider.\n- What's the most likely cause of my symptoms?\n- What kinds of tests do I need?\n- What treatments are available?\n- I have other health conditions. How can I best manage them together?\nYour health care provider is likely to ask you a number of questions. Being ready to answer them may leave time to go over points you want to discuss in depth. You may be asked:\n- Have you injured your knee recently? If so, describe the injury in detail.\n- Does your knee \"lock\" or feel unstable?\n- Has your knee felt warm or looked red? Do you have a fever?\n- Do you play recreational sports? If so, what sports?\n- Do you have any type of arthritis?\n- Do you have a family history of autoimmune disease?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'Condition': 'A swollen knee', 'Symptoms list': ['Swelling around kneecap', 'Stiffness in the knee', 'Pain in the knee', 'Inability to bear weight on the affected knee', 'Redness and warmth in the knee joint'], 'Contextual info': {'Factors affecting diagnostic': ['Joint fluid test for infection, disease or blood from an injury', 'Age', 'Participation in sports', 'Obesity', 'Injury or chronic health conditions']}, 'Additional test to decide between diagnosis': 'X-ray, Ultrasound, MRI, Arthrocentesis', 'Related diagnosis': ['Torn ligament, particularly the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)', 'Cartilage (meniscus) tear', 'Irritation from overuse', 'Broken bones', 'Osteoarthritis', 'Rheumatoid arthritis', 'Infection', 'Gout', 'Pseudogout', 'Bursitis', 'Cysts', 'Tumors']}"}]}

See Burns - Acute Management\n\n# Assessment\nAs per Burns - Acute Management\n\n# Management\nThe principles of burn wound management are\n- Relieve pain & distress\n- Apply and maintain an appropriate dressing\n\t- Limit fluid loss\n\t- Prevent infection\n\t- Promote healing\n- Optimise nutrition\n- Prevent complications\nAnalgesia\n- Manage pain using multimodal analgesia\n- Control itch with non-sedating antihistamines\n- Mitigate stress and anxiety with techniques such as distraction and therapeutic play\n- Additional analgesia and sedation should be used prior to dressing cares. Anxiety and distress increases a child\u2019s analgesia requirements and reduce compliance with cares\nBurns Dressings\n- The size, depth, area of the burn and amount of moisture required for optimal healing, are considered when selecting a dressing type\n- Acute burns are initially covered with both a:\n\t- Primary dressing on the wound. Examples include silver impregnated (ActicoatTM, Mepliex \u00ae Ag) or medicated paraffin (BactigrasTM) dressings\n\t- Secondary dressing over the primary dressing to absorb exudate and secure the primary dressing in place. Examples include low-adherent (eg Mepitel\u2122, MelolinTM with HyperfixTM) or crepe dressings\n- Dressing advice can be obtained from a local paediatric burns unit\nDressing changes\n- Daily dressing changes are not advised\n- Timing of dressing change relates to the product applied (eg Acticoat 3TMneeds to be changed in 3 days; Acticoat 7TM in 7 days)\n- If there are concerns of poor wound healing, particularly if there are no signs of healing within 10 days, refer to paediatric burn service for assessment\n- Supplementary and adjunct procedural analgesia may be indicated. Consider nitrous oxide or intranasal fentanyl\nNutrition\n- Children with burns have increased metabolic and nutritional requirements\n- Early nasogastric feeding should be started in children with facial burns, injuries or comorbidities that prevent adequate oral intake\n- Regular weight measurements aid assessment of adequate nutrition\n- A dietitian should be consulted to ensure nutritional needs are met. Consider assessing and supplementing vitamin A, vitamin C and zinc levels to promote wound healing\nPreventing Burn Complications\n- Positioning\n- Burn areas should be elevated to limit oedema and monitored for compromise of peripheral circulation. Splinting may also be needed to prevent contractures and maintain range of movement\n- Consult an occupational therapist and/or physiotherapist for:\n- Deep dermal or full thickness burns crossing flexor surfaces of a joint\n- Circumferential burns\n- Significant oedema limiting limb function or vascular integrity (poor capillary return, cool to touch distal to burn)\nPreventing Infection\n- Gloves must be worn for dressing changes\n- Burns TBSA >10% may require additional infection control measures including isolation \u2013 follow local Burns Unit infection precautions\n- Fever is a common reaction to the hypermetabolic state and immune response following a burn. Child must be assessed for other causes\n- Prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended in burns\n- If there is concern the burn wound is infected, send a swab for MCS and treat with empiric antibiotics as per local guidelines\n- Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a rare complication of an infected burn and can be life threatening. See Sepsis - assessment and management\nPsychosocial care\nThe consequences of a child sustaining a burn can be profound on the child and family. Caring for the child includes support for family members, which may include multidisciplinary team approach to support rehabilitation and transition back to community and school\n\n# Consider consultation with local paediatric team when\n- Concern regarding ability to care for burns at home\n- Suspected non accidental injury, self-inflicted burns or assault\n\n# Consider transfer when\n- Child requiring care beyond the comfort level of the hospital\nFor emergency advice and paediatric or neonatal ICU transfers, see Retrieval Services.\n\n# Consider discharge when\n- Carer able to provide adequate care for child\u2019s burn and follow-up assured\n- Minor burns may be referred to an outpatient burn service for follow-up within 1 week"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'Condition': 'Burns', 'Symptoms list': ['Pain & Distress', 'Potential infection if wound healing is poor', 'Increased metabolic and nutritional requirements', 'Potential circulation compromise due to oedema around burn areas', 'Fever'], 'Contextual info': {'Factors affecting diagnostic': ['Size, depth and area of burn', 'Level of moisture required for healing', 'Other comorbidities', 'Level of pain and distress', 'Signs of infection', 'Adequacy of nutrition', 'Presence of oedema', 'Potential psychological repercussions']}, 'Additional test to decide between diagnosis': '', 'Related diagnosis': []}"}]}

However, current evidence on its efficacy is inadequate in quality and quantity. Therefore, this procedure should only be used with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit or research.\nClinicians wishing to undertake extracorporeal albumin dialysis for acute liver failure should take the following actions.\nInform the clinical governance leads in their Trusts.\nEnsure that patients and their carers understand the uncertainty about the procedure's efficacy and provide them with clear written information (subject to the requirement for an emergency procedure). In addition, the use of NICE's information for patients ('Understanding NICE guidance') is recommended.\nAudit and review clinical outcomes of all patients having extracorporeal albumin dialysis for acute liver failure (see section 3.1).\nNICE encourages further research into extracorporeal albumin dialysis for acute liver failure. This should describe clearly the indications for treatment. Short- and longer-term survival and the numbers of patients 'bridged to transplant' should be documented and compared with standard treatments. Further information about the utility of biochemical markers to guide the frequency of treatment would be helpful. NICE may review the procedure on publication of further evidence.# The procedure\n\n# Indications and current treatments\nIn acute liver failure there is rapid deterioration of liver function. It has a high mortality rate. Causes include poisoning due to alcohol, pharmaceutical or recreational drugs and viral infection. Less common causes are metabolic disease and acute fatty liver of pregnancy.\nThere are few treatment options for patients with diminishing liver function. Some patients recover liver function with supportive medical therapy including haemodialysis/filtration. Other patients need transplantation. However, there is a shortage of donor livers.\n\n# Outline of the procedure\nThis procedure aims to support the patient until either their own liver function recovers or a transplant becomes available. The procedure removes toxins bound to albumin in the blood in addition to the water-soluble toxins that can be removed by haemodialysis.\nThe blood is dialysed through a membrane against an albumin-rich dialysate. Toxic molecules bound to albumin in the blood pass through the membrane and bind onto the albumin molecules of the dialysate. The dialysate is then passed through an activated charcoal and an anion-exchange resin column (to remove toxins bound to albumin) and through a conventional filter (to remove water-soluble toxins). The dialysate is thus regenerated, and can be recirculated against the patient's blood.\nA number of different systems are available for this procedure.\nSections 2.3 and 2.4 describe efficacy and safety outcomes from the published literature that the Committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more detailed information on the evidence, see the overview.\n\n# Efficacy\nA meta-analysis of 4 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 2 non-randomised controlled studies, which included 128 patients in total, reported no significant difference in 30-day all-cause mortality between patients who had extracorporeal albumin dialysis and those who had standard medical treatment (relative risk  0.56; 95% confidence interval  0.28 to 1.14; p = 0.11). No significant differences in mortality were reported between treatment groups in the subgroups of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.12 to 2.17; p = 0.35) or those with acute liver failure (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.15 to 1.58; p = 0.23).\nAn RCT of 24 patients with cirrhosis of the liver treated by albumin dialysis or standard haemodialysis reported no significant difference in 6-month survival between 3 treatment groups (6/8 and 5/8 patients who had albumin dialysis by 2 different systems, and 3/6 patients who had standard haemodialysis, survived) (p = 0.40).\nA non-randomised controlled trial of 79 patients with acute alcoholic liver disease reported that survival at 3-year follow-up was significantly greater after extracorporeal albumin dialysis (52% ) than after standard medical therapy (17% ) (p = 0.0035). A non-randomised controlled trial of 159 patients reported no significant difference in overall survival at 6-month follow-up between patients treated by extracorporeal albumin dialysis (75% ) and patients treated with standard medical therapy (61% ) (p = 0.07).\nThe Specialist Advisers listed key efficacy outcomes as survival or successful bridge to transplant, reduced intracranial pressure/encephalopathy and improved haemodynamic stability.\n\n# Safety\nA case series of 30 patients reported that 30% (9/30) of patients developed positive blood cultures 2\u201317 days after extracorporeal albumin dialysis treatment. All 9 patients died.\nA case report of 2 patients treated by albumin dialysis described severe pulmonary oedema in both patients. (Therapy was suspended in 1 patient.) In both patients the oedema resolved within 24 hours of aggressive medical treatment. One patient died at 9 days and the other at 201 days of follow-up.\nA case series of 191 patients treated by 2027 extracorporeal albumin dialysis sessions reported transitory hypotension in 14% (292/2027) of treatments. Transitory hypoglycaemia requiring medical management occurred in 17% (335/2027) of treatments, all in patients with Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores of 30\u201340 (MELD scores range from 1  to 40 ).\nThe Specialist Advisers listed adverse events as increased variceal bleeding and infection. They considered theoretical adverse events to include coagulopathy, shock, electrolyte abnormalities and thrombosis in the dialysis circuit.# Further information\nThis guidance requires that clinicians undertaking the procedure make special arrangements for audit. NICE has identified relevant audit criteria and has developed an audit tool (which is for use at local discretion).\nFor related NICE guidance see our website.\n\n# Information for patients\nNICE has produced information on this procedure for patients and carers ('Understanding NICE guidance'). It explains the nature of the procedure and the guidance issued by NICE, and has been written with patient consent in mind.# About this guidance\nNICE interventional procedure guidance makes recommendations on the safety and efficacy of the procedure. It does not cover whether or not the NHS should fund a procedure. Funding decisions are taken by local NHS bodies after considering the clinical effectiveness of the procedure and whether it represents value for money for the NHS. It is for healthcare professionals and people using the NHS in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and is endorsed by Healthcare Improvement Scotland for implementation by NHSScotland.\nThis guidance was developed using the NICE interventional procedure guidance process.\nIt updates and replaces NICE interventional procedure guidance 45.\nThis guidance has been incorporated into the NICE pathway on alcohol use disorders, along with other related guidance and products.\nWe have produced a summary of this guidance for patients and carers. Tools to help you put the guidance into practice and information about the evidence it is based on are also available.\nChanges since publication\nJanuary 2012: minor maintenance.\nYour responsibility\nThis guidance represents the views of NICE and was arrived at after careful consideration of the available evidence.

This reduces the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart, causing chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, and other signs and symptoms of heart disease.\nClogging or narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to the heart can occur not only in the heart's largest arteries (the coronary arteries) but also in the heart's smaller blood vessels.\nSmall vessel disease may also be called:\n- Coronary microvascular disease\n- Microvascular endothelial dysfunction\nSmall vessel disease is treatable but may be difficult to detect. The condition is typically diagnosed after a health care provider finds little or no narrowing in the main arteries of the heart despite the presence of symptoms that suggest heart disease.\nSmall vessel disease is more common in women and in people who have diabetes or high blood pressure.\n\n# Symptoms\nSmall vessel disease signs and symptoms include:\n- Chest pain, squeezing or discomfort (angina), which may get worse with activity or emotional stress\n- Discomfort in the left arm, jaw, neck, back or abdomen along with chest pain\n- Shortness of breath\n- Tiredness and lack of energy\nIf you've been treated for coronary artery disease with angioplasty and stents and your signs and symptoms haven't gone away, you might also have small vessel disease.\n\n# When to see a doctor\nSeek emergency medical care if you're having chest pain and other signs and symptoms such as shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, dizziness, or pain that spreads beyond your chest to one or both of your arms or to your neck.\nIt might be hard to tell if some symptoms are due to small vessel disease, especially if you don't have chest pain. See your health care provider to determine the cause of your symptoms.\nIf you have new or unexplained chest pain or think you're having a heart attack, call 911 or emergency medical assistance immediately.\n\n# Causes\nIn coronary small vessel disease, the small arteries don't relax (dilate) as usual. As a result, the heart doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood.\nExperts think that the causes of small vessel disease are the same as the causes for diseases affecting the larger vessels of the heart, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity and diabetes.\n\n# Risk factors\nSmall vessel disease is more common in women than in men. Risk factors for small vessel disease include:\n- Body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher (obesity)\n- Diabetes\n- Family history of the disease, especially in women\n- High blood pressure\n- Inactive lifestyle\n- Increasing age: older than 45 in men and older than 55 in women\n- Insulin resistance\n- Polycystic ovary syndrome\n- Tobacco use\n- Unhealthy cholesterol levels\n- Unhealthy diet\n\n# Complications\nSmall vessel disease can make it harder for the heart to pump blood to the rest of the body. A possible complication of small vessel disease is a heart attack.\n\n# Prevention\nThings you can do that might reduce your risk of small vessel disease include:\n- Don't smoke or use other tobacco products. If you smoke or use tobacco, stop. Talk to your health care provider if you have trouble quitting.\n- Eat a heart-healthy diet. Choose a diet rich in whole grains, lean meat, low-fat dairy, and fruits and vegetables. Limit salt, sugar, alcohol, saturated fat and trans fats.\n- Exercise regularly. Regular exercise helps improve heart muscle function and keeps blood flowing through the arteries. Aim for at least 150 minutes a week of moderate activity such as walking.\n- Maintain a healthy weight. Excess weight strains the heart and can contribute to high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes.\n- Manage cholesterol. Ask your health care provider how often you should have your cholesterol numbers checked. If your bad cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) levels are high, your health care provider may prescribe changes to your diet and medications to help lower your cholesterol levels and protect your cardiovascular health.\n- Control blood pressure. Ask your health care provider how frequently you should have your blood pressure measured. He or she might recommend more-frequent checks if you have high blood pressure or a history of heart disease.\n- Control blood sugar. Work with your health care provider to establish blood sugar goals that are right for you.\n- Manage stress. Find ways to help reduce emotional stress. Getting more exercise, practicing mindfulness, listening to music and connecting with others in support groups are some ways to reduce stress.# Diagnosis & treatment\n\n# Diagnosis\nTo diagnose small vessel disease, your health care provider will usually do a physical exam and ask questions about your medical history and family history of heart disease. He or she will likely listen to your heart with a stethoscope.\nThe tests used to diagnose small vessel disease are similar to those used to diagnosis other types of heart disease and include:\n- Stress test with imaging. A stress test measures how the heart and blood vessels respond to activity. You may be asked to walk on a treadmill or pedal a stationary bike while connected to a heart monitor. Or you may be given an IV drug to stimulate the heart in a way similar to exercise. Blood flow to the heart muscle is measured with ultrasound images (echocardiogram) or with nuclear imaging scans.\n- Coronary angiogram. This test helps determine if the main arteries to the heart are blocked. A long, thin flexible tube (catheter) is inserted into a blood vessel, usually in the groin or wrist, and guided to the heart. Dye flows through the catheter to arteries in the heart. The dye makes the arteries easier to see on X-ray images and video. Additional tests may be done during an angiogram to measure blood flow through the heart.\nCoronary angiogram. This test helps determine if the main arteries to the heart are blocked. A long, thin flexible tube (catheter) is inserted into a blood vessel, usually in the groin or wrist, and guided to the heart. Dye flows through the catheter to arteries in the heart. The dye makes the arteries easier to see on X-ray images and video.\nAdditional tests may be done during an angiogram to measure blood flow through the heart.\n- CT coronary angiogram. This other type of angiogram uses a powerful X-ray machine to produce a series of images of the heart and its blood vessels. You'll lie on a long table that slides through a short, tunnel-like machine (CT scanner). Dye injected through an IV in the arm or hand makes blood vessels easier to see on the CT images.\n- Positron emission tomography (PET). This test uses a radioactive tracer and medication to measure blood flow to the heart muscle. After the tracer is injected, you usually lie in a doughnut-shaped machine to have images taken of the heart.\n\n# Treatment\nThe goals of treatment for small vessel disease are to control the narrowing of the small blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack and to relieve pain.\nMedications for small vessel disease may include:\n- Nitroglycerin (Nitrostat, Nitro-Dur). Nitroglycerin tablets, sprays and patches can ease chest pain by relaxing the coronary arteries and improving blood flow.\n- Beta blockers. These drugs slow the heart rate and decrease blood pressure.\n- Calcium channel blockers. These drugs relax the muscles around the coronary arteries and cause the blood vessels to open, increasing blood flow to the heart. Calcium channel blockers also help control high blood pressure and coronary artery spasms.\n- Statins. These medications help lower bad cholesterol, which contributes to the narrowing of the arteries. Statins also help relax the blood vessels of the heart and treat blood vessel damage.\n- ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Drugs called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) help open blood vessels and lower blood pressure. This makes it easier for the heart to pump blood.\n- Ranolazine (Ranexa). This medication eases chest pain by altering sodium and calcium levels.\n- Aspirin. Aspirin can limit inflammation and prevent blood clots.\n- Metformin. This drug is typically prescribed to lower blood sugar in people with diabetes, but it can improve blood vessel health even in those who don't have diabetes.\nIf you're diagnosed with small vessel disease, you'll need regular checkups with your health care provider.\n\n# Self care\nHeart-healthy lifestyle changes can help prevent and manage small vessel disease. Lifestyle changes may include:\n- Losing weight if you're not at a healthy weight\n- Getting regular physical activity\n- Eating a healthy diet that's low in salt and rich in fruit, vegetables, lean protein and whole grains\n- Quitting smoking or tobacco use\n\n# Alternative medicine\nSometimes, the dietary supplement L-arginine may benefit people with small vessel disease who haven't been helped by other medications. L-arginine is an amino acid that helps relax blood vessels.\nTalk to your health care provider before taking any supplements to make sure that they won't interact with other medications that you take.\n\n# Preparing for your appointment\nIf you've had chest pains or other symptoms of heart disease, your primary care provider will likely refer you to a doctor trained in heart diseases (cardiologist).\nHere's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.\nWhen you make the appointment, ask if there's anything you need to do in advance, such as avoiding food or drinks before a specific test.\nBefore your appointment, make a list of:\n- Your symptoms, including any that seem unrelated to the reason for your appointment\n- Important personal information, including major stresses and recent life changes\n- Any personal and family medical history of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes or high cholesterol\n- All medications, vitamins or other supplements you take, including the doses\n- Questions to ask your care provider\nFor small vessel disease, basic questions to ask your health care provider include:\n- What's causing my symptoms?\n- Are there other possible causes for my symptoms?\n- What tests do I need?\n- What treatments are available and which do you recommend for me?\n- What are the alternatives to the primary approach you're suggesting?\n- I have other health conditions. How can I best manage them together?\n- Should I see a specialist?\n- Are there brochures or other printed material I can have? What websites do you recommend?\nDon't hesitate to ask other questions.\nYour health care provider is likely to ask you questions, such as:\n- When did your symptoms begin?\n- Do you always have symptoms or do they occur occasionally?\n- How severe are your symptoms?\n- What, if anything, makes your symptoms worse?\n- Do your symptoms get worse when you're active?\n- What, if anything, makes your symptoms better?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'Condition': 'Small vessel disease', 'Symptoms list': ['Chest pain, squeezing or discomfort', 'Discomfort in the left arm, jaw, neck, back or abdomen along with chest pain', 'Shortness of breath', 'Tiredness and lack of energy'], 'Contextual info': {'Factors affecting diagnostic': ['Gender', 'Presence of diabetes', 'Presence of high blood pressure']}, 'Additional test to decide between diagnosis': 'Stress test with imaging, Coronary angiogram, CT coronary angiogram, Positron emission tomography (PET)', 'Related diagnosis': ['Coronary artery disease', 'Coronary microvascular disease', 'Microvascular endothelial dysfunction']}"}]}

Therefore, this procedure should only be used in the context of research. In particular, studies should report the effect of the procedure on local tumour control and patient survival.# The procedure\n\n# Indications and current treatments\nThe most common type of renal cancer in adults is renal cell carcinoma. Symptoms and signs may include pain and haematuria. Some patients are diagnosed during investigation with imaging for other disorders. Patients with certain genetic syndromes that predispose them to kidney tumours may be diagnosed during routine imaging surveillance. Establishing the diagnosis and assessing the prognosis of some renal tumours can be difficult, and not all are actively treated.\nTreatment options include laparoscopic (or open) partial or total nephrectomy, and ablation techniques including radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation. Drug therapy is commonly used for advanced renal cancer. Irreversible electroporation is a non-thermal cell-destruction technique, which is claimed to allow targeted destruction of cancerous cells with less damage to surrounding structures (such as major blood vessels and ducts).\n\n# Outline of the procedure\nThe aim of irreversible electroporation is to destroy cancerous cells by subjecting them to a series of short electrical pulses using high-voltage direct current. This creates multiple holes in the cell membrane, irreversibly damaging the cell's homeostasis mechanisms and leading to cell death.\nThe procedure is performed with the patient under general anaesthesia. A neuromuscular blocking agent is essential to prevent uncontrolled severe muscle contractions caused by the electric current. Bipolar or unipolar electrode needles are introduced percutaneously (or by open surgical or laparoscopic approaches) and guided into place in and adjacent to the target tumour using imaging guidance. A series of very short electrical pulses is delivered over several minutes to ablate the tumour. The electrodes may then be repositioned to extend the zone of electroporation until the entire tumour and an appropriate margin have been ablated. Cardiac synchronisation is used to time delivery of the electrical pulse within the refractory period of the heart cycle, minimising the risk of arrhythmia.\nSections 2.3 and 2.4 describe efficacy and safety outcomes from the published literature that the Committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more detailed information on the evidence, see the overview.\n\n# Efficacy\nA case series of 38\u00a0patients including 7\u00a0patients with renal cancer (10\u00a0tumours) reported a complete response in 5\u00a0tumours and progressive disease in 5\u00a0tumours at 3-month follow-up, assessed by modified 'Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors' (modified RECIST). Computed tomography follow-up at 3\u00a0months confirmed ablation of the tumour in 5 of the 7\u00a0patients, although 2\u00a0patients needed a second irreversible electroporation procedure.\nThe Specialist Advisers listed key efficacy outcomes as local tumour control, time to progression, and patient survival.\n\n# Safety\nThe case series of 38\u00a0patients reported transient cardiac arrhythmia in 6\u00a0patients (4\u00a0patients had ventricular tachycardia, 1\u00a0patient had supraventricular tachycardia and 1\u00a0patient had atrial fibrillation). Two of these patients had cardiac synchronisation and 4\u00a0did not. All of the arrhythmias resolved without treatment except for the atrial fibrillation in 1\u00a0patient, which was treated by cardioversion.\nA case series of 21\u00a0patients with primary or metastatic cancer (liver, kidney or lung) reported transient ventricular tachycardia during 25% (7/28) of procedures. In 4 of the 7\u00a0procedures, arterial blood pressure was 'markedly decreased' (not defined). The authors noted that a synchronisation device was used from early in the trial, but they had variable success with synchronisation. Intraoperative supraventricular extrasystole was reported in 1\u00a0patient in a case series of 6\u00a0patients. No electrocardiography-related changes were detected after the procedure or at follow-up (after 12\u00a0weeks).\nThe case series of 38\u00a0patients reported partial ureteric obstruction and increasing creatinine level in 1\u00a0patient with renal cancer (timing not reported). The patient's ureter had been damaged previously by radiofrequency ablation. The obstruction was treated by inserting a ureteric stent.\nThe case series of 21\u00a0patients with tumours in the liver, kidney or lung reported extreme increases in blood pressure during the procedure (up to 200/100\u00a0mmHg from a baseline of 140/60\u00a0mmHg) in 7% (2/28) of procedures (both patients were being treated for renal cancer). In 1\u00a0patient, the blood pressure increase lasted for more than a few minutes and medical treatment was needed. The position of the electrodes was subsequently checked, and thought to be in the adrenal gland. Transient increases in systolic blood pressure of approximately 20 to 30\u00a0mmHg after treatment cycles were reported for all patients in the same study.\nThe Specialist Advisers listed additional theoretical adverse effects as damage to surrounding organs, minor bleeding, sepsis and ureteric stricture.\n\n# Other comments\nThe Committee noted the claim that this procedure may cause less damage to surrounding structures (such as major blood vessels) than other types of ablative treatment for renal cancer, but considered that more evidence is needed to support this.# Further information\nFor related NICE guidance see the NICE website.\n\n# Information for patients\nNICE has produced information on this procedure for patients and carers (Information for the public).

This involves relieving low back pain by delivering heat energy to the damaged disc.\n\n# Recommendations\nCurrent evidence on percutaneous intradiscal radiofrequency treatment of the intervertebral disc nucleus for low back pain raises no major safety concerns. The evidence on its efficacy is limited in quantity and quality. Therefore, this procedure should only be used with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit or research.\nClinicians wishing to do percutaneous intradiscal radiofrequency treatment of the intervertebral disc nucleus for low back pain should:\nInform the clinical governance leads in their NHS trusts.\nEnsure that patients understand the uncertainty about the procedure's efficacy and provide them with clear written information. In particular, patients should be informed about other treatment options, about the possibility that the procedure may not relieve their symptoms, and about the risk of a flare\u2011up of their pain after treatment. In addition, the use of NICE's information for the public is recommended.\nAudit and review clinical outcomes of all patients having percutaneous intradiscal radiofrequency treatment of the intervertebral disc nucleus for low back pain (see section\u00a07.2).\nNICE encourages further research into percutaneous intradiscal radiofrequency treatment of the intervertebral disc nucleus for low back pain. Further research should include details of patient selection, the duration of patients' symptoms, and a precise account of the technique used for treatment. Outcome measures should include pain relief and quality of life. Long\u2011term follow\u2011up data should include details of any subsequent procedures.\nThis replaces previous guidance on percutaneous intradiscal radiofrequency thermocoagulation for lower back pain (NICE interventional procedure guidance\u00a083).# Indications and current treatments\nLumbar disc herniation occurs when the nucleus pulposus of an intervertebral disc protrudes through a tear in the surrounding annulus fibrosus. Symptoms include pain in the back, pain in the leg (sciatica), and numbness or weakness in the leg. Serious neurological sequelae may sometimes occur.\nConservative treatments include analgesics, non\u2011steroidal anti\u2011inflammatory medication, manual therapy and acupuncture. Epidural corticosteroid injections may be used to reduce nerve pain in the short term. Lumbar discectomy is considered if there is evidence of severe nerve compression or persistent symptoms that have not responded to conservative treatment. This can be done by open discectomy or less invasive percutaneous approaches.\nPercutaneous intradiscal radiofrequency treatment of the intervertebral disc nucleus may be used for low back pain caused by contained herniated discs that has not responded to conservative treatment, when open surgery is not suitable.# The procedure\nPercutaneous intradiscal radiofrequency treatment aims to enhance the structural integrity of the intervertebral disc. It aims to reduce low back pain by using radiofrequency heat energy to alter the biomechanics of the intervertebral disc and to destroy the nociceptive pain fibres.\nProvocative discography is sometimes used before this procedure, to identify the symptomatic disc. The procedure is done with the patient under sedation in the prone position and using local anaesthesia. A needle is inserted into the disc under fluoroscopic guidance. An electrode or flexible catheter is then passed through the needle and into the centre of the disc nucleus. Once in position, it is slowly heated and kept at the chosen temperature (around 70\u00baC) for a predetermined time, usually for about 1\u20132\u00a0minutes, before it is removed.\nA recent modification to this procedure uses pulsed radiofrequency, which generates less heat in the disc nucleus but is applied for a longer period of time.# Efficacy\nThis section describes efficacy outcomes from the published literature that the Committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more detailed information on the evidence, see the interventional procedure overview.\nA randomised controlled trial of 28\u00a0patients treated by percutaneous intradiscal radiofrequency thermocoagulation (PIRFT) of the intervertebral disc nucleus (n=13) or sham (n=15) reported treatment success (defined as a 2\u2011point reduction on a visual analogue scale  and pain reduction of 50% or more on a 7\u2011point global perceived effect scale ranging from much worse  to total pain relief ) in 1\u00a0patient in the PIRFT group and in none in the sham group, 12\u00a0months after the procedure (no significant difference between groups).\nA case series of 76\u00a0patients treated by pulsed radiofrequency reported good clinical success (defined as 50% or more pain reduction on a 10\u2011point numeric rating scale) in 38% (29/76) of patients at 3\u00a0months. It reported moderate clinical success (defined as a minimum of 2\u00a0points reduction in pain intensity) in 30% (23/76) of patients at 3\u00a0months. Pulsed radiofrequency had no effect on pain symptoms in 29% (22/76) of patients at 3\u00a0months. In the group who had 50% or more pain reduction at 3\u00a0months, 79% (23/29) of patients still had this effect at 12\u2011month follow\u2011up. The remaining 21% (6/29) reported pain that was the same as at baseline (before the procedure). The same study reported treatment failure (defined as conversion to surgery) in 3% (2/76) of patients at 12\u2011month follow\u2011up.\nThe randomised controlled trial of 28\u00a0patients treated by PIRFT or sham reported mean changes in pain VAS scores from baseline to 8\u00a0weeks of \u22120.61 in the PIRFT group and \u22121.14 in the sham group (VAS measured for 4\u00a0days and minimum and maximum scores recorded; difference between groups not significant). A randomised trial of 37\u00a0patients treated by PIRFT for 120\u00a0seconds (group\u00a0A, n=19) or PIRFT for 360\u00a0seconds (group\u00a0B, n=18) reported significant differences between mean pain scores before the procedure (\u00b1 standard deviation; SD) and mean pain scores at 1\u00a0month in both groups, measured by VAS. The mean pain scores were 6.73\u00b11.55 compared against 3.36\u00b10.89 for group\u00a0A and 6.27\u00b11.31 compared against 3.33\u00b10.97 for group\u00a0B; p<0.05 for the difference compared against pre\u2011treatment scores. It reported no significant differences from pre\u2011treatment scores at\u00a02-, 3- and 6\u2011month follow\u2011up in either group.\nA non\u2011randomised trial of 31\u00a0patients treated by pulsed radiofrequency (n=15) or intradiscal electrothermal therapy (IDET, n=16) reported mean numerical rating scores for pain of 7.2 at baseline and 2.5 at 6\u2011month follow\u2011up in the pulsed radiofrequency group and 7.5 at baseline and 1.7 at 6\u00a0months in the IDET group (significant improvements within groups, p<0.01). No significant differences in mean numerical rating scale scores were observed between the groups at 6\u2011month follow\u2011up.\nThe randomised controlled trial of 28\u00a0patients treated by PIRFT or sham reported mean changes in function scores of \u22122.62 (measured using the Oswestry disability scale ; from 0 to 100 with lower scores indicating less disability) in the PIRFT group and \u22124.93 in the sham group at 8\u00a0weeks (p\u00a0value for the difference between groups was not significant, and no significance test was reported for within group changes). The randomised trial of 37\u00a0patients comparing PIRFT for 120\u00a0seconds against PIRFT for 360\u00a0seconds reported significant differences between mean ODS scores before the treatment and at 1\u00a0month (\u00b1SD) in both groups (42\u00b19% compared against 26\u00b111% for 120\u00a0seconds and 42\u00b110% compared against 24\u00b112% for 360\u00a0seconds, p0.05).\nA case series of 8\u00a0patients treated by pulsed radiofrequency reported that all patients had stopped their regular pain medication after the procedure (no further details provided).\nThe specialist advisers listed key efficacy outcomes as reduction of back and leg pain, global improvement, reduction in disability, and work and domestic productivity.# Safety\nThis section describes safety outcomes from the published literature that the Committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more detailed information on the evidence, see the interventional procedure overview.\nFlare\u2011up pain lasting from a few days to 6\u00a0weeks was reported in a case series of 76\u00a0patients with discogenic pain treated by pulsed radiofrequency in the intervertebral disc nucleus. The pain was treated by non\u2011steroidal anti\u2011inflammatory drugs or paracetamol (number of patients not reported).\nDisc herniation was reported in 5% (2/39) of patients in a case series of 39\u00a0patients with low back pain treated by percutaneous intradiscal radiofrequency thermocoagulation, but it was unclear whether this was associated with the procedure (timing not reported).\nIn addition to safety outcomes reported in the literature, specialist advisers are asked about anecdotal adverse events (events which they have heard about) and about theoretical adverse events (events which they think might possibly occur, even if they have never done so). For this procedure, specialist advisers listed the following anecdotal adverse events: visceral or vascular injury and discitis. They considered that the following were theoretical adverse events: instrument failure; technical failure at L5 or S1 (lumbosacral joints) because of difficult access; needle misplacement through disc to retroperitoneum or behind to dura or spinal canal; damage to other structures including nerve damage; bleeding; infection; instability; infarction; epidural fibrosis; late disc protrusion; and paralysis.# Further information\nFor related NICE guidance, see the NICE website.\nThis guidance requires that clinicians doing the procedure make special arrangements for audit. NICE has identified relevant audit criteria and has developed an audit tool (which is for use at local discretion).\n\n# Information for patients\nNICE has produced information on this procedure for patients and carers (information for the public).

There is no evidence of efficacy in the majority of patients. There are also concerns about the potential risks of the procedure.\nIt is recommended that this procedure should not be used. The Institute's information for the public complements this guidance in explaining the concerns about the procedure.# The procedure\n\n# Indications\nPresbyopia is an age-related and progressive loss of focusing power of the lens in the eye. It leads to a gradual decline in the ability to focus on close objects.\nStandard treatment for presbyopia is the use of corrective spectacles. As the condition worsens, prescriptions need to be changed accordingly.\n\n# Outline of the procedure\nScleral expansion surgery involves making small incisions in the eye and inserting bands to stretch the part of the sclera that lies beneath the ciliary muscles that control accommodation. This procedure is claimed to improve accommodation.\n\n# Efficacy\nAll studies identified were of poor quality. The evidence was limited to one non-randomised controlled study of 29 patients, two very small case series (of six and three patients, respectively) and two case reports. In the controlled study, in which the dominant eye was operated on and the other eye served as a control, improvement in median reading acuity score at 20 cm was reported as \u20130.41 for operated eyes and \u20130.35 for control eyes (p < 0.03), indicating that the improvement in operated eyes was greater. No significant difference in reading acuity was found at 30 cm or 40 cm. One case series reported that near visual acuity improved temporarily in 3/8 eyes (38%), but it was no better than before surgery at day 360. In the same study, implanted bands were removed from three eyes upon patient request because of lack of benefit. In another case series of three patients, scleral expansion surgery failed to restore accommodation in any patients. For more details, refer to the Sources of evidence section.\nThe Specialist Advisors considered the evidence to suggest that the procedure is not efficacious. One Advisor noted that the procedure was controversial because it was based on a novel theory of the mechanism of accommodation of the human eye that was in direct opposition to other generally accepted theories.\n\n# Safety\nThe complications reported in the identified studies were: two case reports of band removal because of band migration or chronic pain and swelling; two cases of perforated conjunctiva in a study of 8 patients; and one report of transient elevation of intraocular pressure in a study of 29 patients. For more details, refer to the Sources of evidence section.\nThe Specialist Advisors listed the main potential adverse events as intraocular haemorrhage, retinal detachment, endophthalmitis, glaucoma, conjunctival scarring and scleral thinning.\nAndrew DillonChief ExecutiveJuly 2004# Further information\n\n# Sources of evidence\nThe evidence considered by the Interventional Procedures Advisory Committee is described in the following document.\n'Interventional procedure overview of sclera expansion surgery for presbyopia', April 2003.\n\n# Information for the public\nNICE has produced information on this procedure for patients and carers ('Understanding NICE guidance'). It explains the nature of the procedure and the guidance issued by NICE, and has been written with patient consent in mind.# About this guidance\nNICE interventional procedure guidance makes recommendations on the safety and efficacy of the procedure. It does not cover whether or not the NHS should fund a procedure. Funding decisions are taken by local NHS bodies after considering the clinical effectiveness of the procedure and whether it represents value for money for the NHS. It is for healthcare professionals and people using the NHS in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and is endorsed by Healthcare Improvement Scotland for implementation by NHSScotland.\nThis guidance was developed using the NICE interventional procedure guidance process.\nWe have produced a summary of this guidance for patients and carers. Information about the evidence it is based on is also available.\nChanges since publication\nJanuary 2012: minor maintenance.\nYour responsibility\nThis guidance represents the views of NICE and was arrived at after careful consideration of the available evidence. Healthcare professionals are expected to take it fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement. This guidance does not, however, override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make appropriate decisions in the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with the patient and/or guardian or carer.\nImplementation of this guidance is the responsibility of local commissioners and/or providers. Commissioners and providers are reminded that it is their responsibility to implement the guidance, in their local context, in light of their duties to avoid unlawful discrimination and to have regard to promoting equality of opportunity. Nothing in this guidance should be interpreted in a way which would be inconsistent with compliance with those duties.\nCopyright\n\u00a9 National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence 2004.

The duct walls may thicken, and the duct may fill with fluid. The milk duct may become blocked or clogged with a thick, sticky substance. The condition often causes no symptoms, but some women may have nipple discharge, breast tenderness or inflammation of the clogged duct (periductal mastitis).\nMammary duct ectasia most often occurs in women during perimenopause \u2014 around age 45 to 55 years \u2014 but it can happen after menopause, too. The condition often improves without treatment. If symptoms persist, you may need antibiotics or possibly surgery to remove the affected milk duct.\nThough it's normal to worry about any changes in your breasts, mammary duct ectasia and periductal mastitis aren't risk factors for breast cancer.\nMammary duct ectasia occurs when one or more milk ducts beneath the nipple becomes wider (dilated). The duct may also fill with fluid and become blocked or clogged with a thick, sticky substance. Mammary duct ectasia usually causes no signs or symptoms, but some women may have nipple discharge, breast tenderness or inflammation of the clogged duct.\n\n# Symptoms\nMammary duct ectasia often doesn't cause any signs or symptoms, but some people experience:\n- A dirty white, greenish or black nipple discharge from one or both nipples\n- Tenderness in the nipple or surrounding breast tissue (areola)\n- Redness of the nipple and areolar tissue\n- A breast lump or thickening near the clogged duct\n- A nipple that's turned inward (inverted)\nA bacterial infection called mastitis also may develop in the affected milk duct, causing breast tenderness, inflammation in the area around the nipple (areola) and fever.\nSigns and symptoms of mammary duct ectasia may improve on their own.\nA nipple that's always been turned inward (inverted) usually isn't a medical concern. But a nipple that has recently turned inward should be checked by a doctor.\n\n# When to see a doctor\nMake an appointment with your doctor if you notice changes in your breasts \u2014 such as a new breast lump, spontaneous nipple discharge, skin redness or inflammation, or an inverted nipple \u2014 that are persistent or that worry you.\n\n# Causes\nYour breasts are made up of connective tissues that include a system of tiny passages that carry milk to the nipples (milk ducts). Mammary duct ectasia occurs when a milk duct beneath the nipple widens. The duct walls may thicken and fill with fluid, becoming blocked or clogged with a sticky substance. Inflammation may result.\nExperts don't know exactly what causes mammary duct ectasia. Some speculate the cause to be associated with:\n- Breast tissue changes due to aging. As you age, the composition of your breast tissue changes from mostly glandular to mostly fatty in a process called involution. These normal breast changes can sometimes lead to a blocked milk duct and the inflammation associated with mammary duct ectasia.\n- Smoking. Cigarette smoking may be associated with widening of milk ducts, which can lead to inflammation and, possibly, mammary duct ectasia.\n- Nipple inversion. A newly inverted nipple may obstruct milk ducts, causing inflammation and infection. A nipple that's newly inverted could also be a sign of a more serious underlying condition, such as cancer.\n\n# Complications\nComplications of mammary duct ectasia are usually minor and often more bothersome than serious. These may include:\n- Nipple discharge. Nipple discharge caused by mammary duct ectasia can be frustrating. Fluid leaking from your nipples can cause embarrassing wetness and staining on your clothes.\n- Breast discomfort. Mammary duct ectasia can cause redness, swelling and tenderness around your nipples.\n- Infection. An inflammatory infection (periductal mastitis) may develop in the affected milk duct, sometimes causing pain in or around the nipple, a general feeling of illness or a fever. Persistent redness and worsening pain could be a sign of a bacterial infection and can lead to an abscess \u2014 a collection of pus in your breast tissue \u2014 which may require a procedure to drain it.\n- Concern about breast cancer. When you notice a change in your breast, you may worry that it's a sign of breast cancer, especially if you develop a hard lump around the nipple or areola. Having a history of mammary duct ectasia doesn't increase your risk of breast cancer. Still, it's important to see your doctor promptly anytime you notice breast changes.# Diagnosis & treatment\n\n# Diagnosis\nBased on information you provide to your doctor and the results of a physical exam, you might need additional tests, including:\n- Diagnostic ultrasound of the nipple and areola. An ultrasound uses sound waves to make images of breast tissue. It allows your doctor to evaluate the milk ducts beneath your nipple. A diagnostic ultrasound lets your doctor focus on an area of suspicion.\n- Diagnostic mammography. Mammography provides X-ray images of your breast and can help your doctor evaluate your breast tissue. A diagnostic mammogram provides more-detailed views of a specific area of your breast than a screening mammogram does.\n\n# Treatment\nMammary duct ectasia doesn't always require treatment. If your symptoms are bothersome, however, treatment options may include:\n- Antibiotics. Your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic for 10 to 14 days to treat an infection caused by mammary duct ectasia. Even if your symptoms greatly improve or disappear completely after starting the antibiotic, it's important to take all your medication as prescribed.\n- Pain medication. You could try a mild pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), as needed for breast discomfort. Follow your doctor's recommendation on which pain reliever is best for you.\n- Surgery. If an abscess has developed and antibiotics and self-care don't work, the affected milk duct may be surgically removed. This procedure is done through a tiny incision at the edge of the colored tissue around your nipple (areola). Surgery rarely is needed for mammary duct ectasia.\n\n# Self care\nTo relieve discomfort associated with mammary duct ectasia, you might try these self-care measures:\n- Apply warm compresses. A warm compress applied to your nipple and surrounding area may soothe painful breast tissue.\n- Use breast pads for nipple discharge. Using breast pads or nursing pads can keep fluid from leaking through your clothing. These pads are available at drugstores and many retail stores that sell baby care products.\n- Wear a support bra. Choose bras with good support to minimize breast discomfort. A well-fitting bra can also help keep a breast pad in place to absorb nipple discharge.\n- Sleep on the opposite side. Avoid sleeping on the same side of your body as your affected breast to help prevent swelling and further discomfort.\n- Stop smoking. Smoking may make it harder to treat an infection, and ongoing smoking may result in recurrent infections or an abscess.\n\n# Preparing for your appointment\nFor evaluation of a new breast lump or changes in your breast, you're likely to start by seeing your primary care doctor. In some cases, based on a clinical breast exam or findings on the mammogram or ultrasound, you may be referred to a breast health specialist.\nThe initial evaluation focuses on your medical history and the signs and symptoms you're experiencing, including how they're related to your menstrual cycle. To prepare for this discussion with your doctor:\n- Take note of all your symptoms, even if they seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment.\n- Review key personal information, including major stresses or recent life changes.\n- Make a list of all medications, vitamins and supplements that you regularly take.\n- Write down questions to ask your doctor, to make sure you remember everything you want to ask.\nFor mammary duct ectasia, here are some questions you might ask your doctor:\n- What's causing my symptoms?\n- Will this condition resolve itself, or will I need treatment?\n- What treatment approach do you recommend?\n- Is there an over-the-counter medication I can take for pain relief?\n- What self-care measures can I try?\n- Do you have printed information I can take home with me? What websites do you recommend?\nYour doctor may ask you a number of questions, such as:\n- How long have you experienced symptoms?\n- Have your symptoms changed over time?\n- Do you experience breast pain? How severe?\n- Do you have nipple discharge? How would you describe the color, consistency and amount?\n- Do your symptoms occur in one or both breasts?\n- Have you had a fever?\n- When was your last mammogram?\n- Have you ever been diagnosed with a precancerous breast condition?\n- Have you ever had a breast biopsy or been diagnosed with a benign breast condition?\n- Has your mother, a sister or anyone else in your family had breast cancer?\n- What, if anything, seems to improve your symptoms?\n- What, if anything, appears to worsen your symptoms?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'Condition': 'Mammary duct ectasia', 'Symptoms list': ['Dirty white, greenish or black nipple discharge', 'Tenderness in the nipple or surrounding breast tissue (areola)', 'Redness of the nipple and areolar tissue', 'Breast lump or thickening near the clogged duct', 'Turned inward (inverted) nipple', 'Breast tenderness', 'Inflammation in the area around the nipple (areola)', 'Fever'], 'Contextual info': {'Factors affecting diagnostic': ['Age', 'Nipple inversion', 'Smoking']}, 'Additional test to decide between diagnosis': 'Diagnostic ultrasound of the nipple and areola, Diagnostic mammography', 'Related diagnosis': ['Periductal mastitis', 'Inverted Nipple', 'Breast cancer']}"}]}

This involves inserting an artificial iris into the eye.\n\n# Recommendations\nEvidence on the safety and efficacy of artificial iris implant insertion for acquired aniridia is limited in quantity and quality. Therefore, this procedure should only be used with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent, and audit or research. Find out what special arrangements mean on the NICE website.\nClinicians wishing to do artificial iris implant insertion for acquired aniridia should:\nInform the clinical governance leads in their NHS trusts.\nGive patients clear information to support shared decision making, including NICE's information for the public.\nEnsure that patients understand the procedure's safety and efficacy, as well as any uncertainties about these.\nAudit and review clinical outcomes of all patients having the procedure. NICE has identified relevant audit criteria and developed an audit tool (which is for use at local discretion).\nThe procedure should only be done by ophthalmic surgeons with appropriate experience and training.\nResearch could include the use of observational data from cohort studies or high-quality case series. Studies should report details of patient selection and the type of implant used. Outcomes should include quality of life and other patient-reported outcomes.\nNICE may update the guidance on publication of further evidence.# The condition, current treatments and procedure\n\n# The condition\nAcquired aniridia means the iris is either missing or incomplete as a result of trauma, surgery or laser treatment.\nPeople with aniridia may be very light sensitive (photophobic) and report symptoms of glare. They may develop other eye problems such as glaucoma, cataract and corneal opacification. The degree of vision loss varies.\n\n# Current treatments\nTreatment includes contact lenses with iris prints and tinted spectacle lenses.\nSurgical implantation of an artificial iris device may be an option for some people with complete or partial acquired aniridia.\n\n# The procedure\nThere are different devices available, including a solid acrylic ring or segment and a flexible silicone disc, which can be custom-made for each patient. The implant has a defined pupil size, which offers a compromise between day and night vision.\nThe artificial iris implant is inserted using local or general anaesthesia. The exact details of the procedure vary according to the type of implant being used.\nFlexible implants are rolled up and inserted through a cut about 3\u00a0mm long at the edge of the cornea, into the posterior chamber of the eye. They are then unfolded and fixed in the eye. If sutures are needed to hold the implant in place, a larger cut may be necessary. The implant insertion can be done on its own or at the time of cataract or lens fixation surgery.\nSolid ring implants are typically inserted during cataract surgery along with an intraocular lens. In some patients, an iris reconstruction lens containing both an artificial iris and a lens is implanted. Depending on the condition of the eye, the lens and iris device may need to be sutured to the sclera.\nThe aim of artificial iris implant insertion is to improve visual acuity, reduce photophobia and glare, and improve the eye's appearance."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'Condition': 'Acquired aniridia', 'Symptoms list': ['Light sensitivity (photophobia)', 'Glare', 'Vision loss', 'Glaucoma', 'Cataract', 'Corneal opacification'], 'Contextual info': {'Factors affecting diagnostic': ['Trauma', 'Surgery', 'Laser treatment']}, 'Additional test to decide between diagnosis': '', 'Related diagnosis': ['Glaucoma', 'Cataract', 'Corneal opacification']}"}]}

In addition, use of the Institute's information for the public is recommended.\nFurther publication of longer-term efficacy outcomes will be useful. Clinicians should submit data to the British Association of Urological Surgeons registry, or the British Society of Urogynaecologists registry (for further information contact the British Society of Urogynaecologists).# The procedure\n\n# Indications\nStress urinary incontinence is the involuntary leakage of urine during exercise or movements such as coughing, sneezing and laughing. It is usually caused by weak or damaged muscles and connective tissues of the pelvic floor, or by weakness of the urethral sphincter itself. It is estimated that 10\u201352% of adult women have some form of incontinence.\nTypically, first-line treatment is conservative and includes pelvic floor muscle training, electrical stimulation and biofeedback. If the condition does not improve, surgical alternatives in women may include colposuspension, tension-free vaginal tape, transobturator foramen procedures or traditional suburethral slings.\n\n# Outline of the procedure\nIntramural urethral bulking aims to augment the urethral wall and increase the urethral closure force. Several millilitres of bulking agent are injected into the submucosa of the proximal urethra just distal to the bladder neck. The injections are usually administered under local anaesthesia, either transurethrally or para-urethrally. Injections are undertaken either under vision using a cytoscope; or blindly, using a non-endoscopic implantation device.\nA number of bulking agents are currently available.\n\n# Efficacy\nA small randomised controlled trial reported that 53% (34/64) of patients treated by urethral bulking with collagen had no incontinence at 12 months, compared with 72% (39/54) treated with conventional open surgery.\nOne case series of patients treated with collagen reported that, after 12 months, 42% (38/90) had either no incontinence or an improvement in symptoms, as measured objectively using cystometry and abdominal leak point pressure. One case series of patients treated with silicone particles reported that 68% (69/102) had either no incontinence or marked improvement after a mean follow-up of 3 months. This proportion decreased to 48% (40/84) after a mean follow-up of 18 months. Four randomised controlled trials reported no difference in efficacy between different bulking agents. For more details, refer to the Sources of evidence.\nThe Specialist Advisors noted that efficacy may depend on patient selection, the bulking agent used and the injection technique.\n\n# Safety\nFive case series reported safety data on a total of 389 patients. The most commonly reported adverse events were urinary tract infection, affecting 1% (1/102) to 12% (11/90) of patients, and urinary retention, affecting 0% (0/40) to 11% (10/90) of patients. Other reported complications included abscess at the injection site, urgency of micturition and prolonged pain. For more details, refer to the Sources of evidence.\nThe Specialist Advisors stated that migration of the bulking agent, voiding difficulties, urinary tract infection and allergic reaction are potential adverse events. Haemorrhage was listed as a rare potential adverse event.\n\n# Other comments\nThe Committee noted that a variety of bulking agents may be used for these procedures which may have different risk and benefit profiles.\nThe Committee particularly noted that the benefits of these procedures diminish with time but that the procedure can be repeated.# Further information\nNICE has issued guidance on tension-free vaginal tape (replaced by NICE clinical guideline 40, 'Urinary incontinence: the management of urinary incontinence in women'), transobturator foramen procedures for stress urinary incontinence and insertion of extra-urethral (non-circumferential) retropubic adjustable compression devices.

It's a common heart problem present at birth (congenital heart defect). The hole occurs in the wall that separates the heart's lower chambers (ventricles).\nA ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a hole in the heart that's present at birth (congenital heart defect). The hole is between the lower heart chambers (right and left ventricles). It allows oxygen-rich blood to move back into the lungs instead of being pumped to the rest of the body.\nA ventricular septal defect (VSD) changes how blood flows through the heart and lungs. Oxygen-rich blood gets pumped back to the lungs instead of out to the body. The oxygen-rich blood mixes with oxygen-poor blood. These changes may increase blood pressure in the lungs and require the heart to work harder to pump blood.\nA small ventricular septal defect may cause no problems. Many small ventricular septal defects (VSDs) close on their own. Babies with medium or larger VSDs may need surgery early in life to prevent complications.\n\n# Symptoms\nSymptoms of serious heart problems present at birth (congenital heart defects) often appear during the first few days, weeks or months of a child's life.\nSymptoms of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) depend on the size of the hole and if there are any other heart problems. A small VSD may never cause symptoms.\nIn general, VSD symptoms in a baby may include:\n- Poor eating\n- Slow or no physical growth (failure to thrive)\n- Fast breathing or breathlessness\n- Easy tiring\n- Whooshing sound when listening to the heart with a stethoscope (heart murmur)\nSymptoms of a ventricular septal defect in adults may include:\n- Shortness of breath, especially when exercising\n- Whooshing sound when listening to the heart with a stethoscope (heart murmur)\n\n# When to see a doctor\nCall your health care provider if your baby:\n- Tires easily when eating or playing\n- Is not gaining weight\n- Becomes breathless when eating or crying\n- Breathes rapidly or is short of breath\nCall your provider if these symptoms develop:\n- Shortness of breath\n- Rapid or irregular heartbeat\n- Fatigue or weakness\n\n# Causes\nVentricular septal defect (VSD) occurs as the baby's heart is developing during pregnancy. The muscular wall separating the heart into left and right sides doesn't form fully, leaving one or more holes. The size of the hole or holes can vary.\nThere's often no clear cause. Genetics and environmental factors may play a role. VSDs can occur alone or with other heart problems present at birth. Rarely, a ventricular septal defect can occur later in life after a heart attack or certain heart procedures.\nTo understand more about ventricular septal defect (VSD), it may be helpful to know how the heart typically works.\nA typical heart has two upper and two lower chambers. The upper chambers, the right and left atria, receive incoming blood. The lower chambers, the more muscular right and left ventricles, pump blood out of the heart. The heart valves, which keep blood flowing in the right direction, are gates at the chamber openings.\nThe typical heart is made of four chambers \u2014 two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles).\n- The right side of the heart moves blood to the lungs.\n- In the lungs, blood picks up oxygen.\n- The lungs pump the oxygen-rich blood to the heart's left side.\n- The left side of the heart pumps the oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body.\nA ventricular septal defect changes the direction of blood flow in the heart and lungs. The hole lets oxygen-rich blood go back into the lungs, instead of going out to the body. Oxygen-rich blood and oxygen-poor blood now mix together. If the ventricular septal defect is large, the blood pressure in the lung arteries may increase. The heart then must work harder to pump blood. A large VSD can also increase the amount of blood flow in the lung arteries, causing congestion.\n\n# Risk factors\nRisk factors for ventricular septal defect include:\n- Premature birth\n- Down syndrome and other genetic conditions\n- Family history of heart problems present at birth (congenital heart defects)\nA baby born with ventricular septal defect may have other heart problems, such as:\n- Atrial septal defect\n- Coarctation of the aorta\n- Double outlet syndrome\n- Patent ductus arteriosus\n- Tetralogy of Fallot\nIf you already have a child with a congenital heart defect, a genetic counselor can discuss the risk of your next child having one.\n\n# Complications\nA small ventricular septal defect (VSD) may never cause any problems. Some medium or large VSDs may be life-threatening. Treatment can help prevent many complications.\nComplications of ventricular septal defect can include:\n- Heart failure. In a heart with a medium or large VSD, the heart works harder and the lungs have too much blood pumped to them. Without treatment, heart failure can develop.\n- Eisenmenger syndrome. An unrepaired hole in the heart can lead to this complication after many years. Irregular blood flow causes the blood vessels in the lungs to become stiff and narrow. Blood pressure rises in the lungs' arteries (pulmonary hypertension). This syndrome permanently damages the blood vessels in the lungs.\n- Endocarditis. This is a rare complication of VSD. An infection causes life-threatening inflammation of the inner lining of the heart's chambers and valves.\n- Other heart problems. These include heart valve disease and irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias).\n\n# Prevention\nBecause the cause is unclear, it may not be possible to prevent ventricular septal defect (VSD). But getting good prenatal care is important. If you have a VSD and are planning to become pregnant, schedule a visit with your health care provider and follow these steps:\n- Get early prenatal care, even before you're pregnant. Talk to your provider before you get pregnant about your health and discuss any lifestyle changes that your doctor may recommend for a healthy pregnancy. Also, be sure you talk to your doctor about any medications you're taking.\n- Take a multivitamin with folic acid. Taking 400 micrograms of folic acid daily has been shown to reduce birth defects in the brain and spinal cord. It may help reduce the risk of heart defects as well.\n- Avoid alcohol. Drinking alcohol during pregnancy increases the risk of congenital heart defects.\n- Don't smoke or use illegal drugs. If you smoke, quit. Smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of a congenital heart defect in the baby. Avoid using illegal drugs as they may harm a developing baby.\n- Get recommended vaccinations. Be sure you're up to date on all of your vaccinations before becoming pregnant. Some infections can be harmful to a developing fetus. For example, having rubella (German measles) during pregnancy can cause problems in a baby's heart development. A blood test done before pregnancy can determine if you're immune to rubella. A vaccine is available for those who aren't immune.\n- Keep diabetes under control. Careful control of blood sugar before and during pregnancy can reduce the risk of congenital heart defects in the baby. Diabetes that develops during pregnancy (gestational diabetes) generally doesn't increase a baby's risk. If you have diabetes, work with your provider to be sure it's well controlled before getting pregnant.\n- Check with your provider before taking any medications. Some medications can cause birth defects. Tell your provider about all the medications you take, including those bought without a prescription.\nIf you have a family history of heart problems present at birth, consider talking with a genetic counselor and a heart doctor (cardiologist) before getting pregnant.# Diagnosis & treatment\n\n# Diagnosis\nSome ventricular septal defects (VSDs) are diagnosed soon after a child is born. However, ventricular septal defects (VSDs) may not be diagnosed until later in life. Sometimes a ventricular septal defect (VSD) can be detected by a pregnancy ultrasound before the baby is born.\nIf ventricular septal defect is present, the health care provider may hear a whooshing sound (heart murmur) when listening to the heart with a stethoscope.\nTests that are done to help diagnose ventricular septal defect include:\n- Echocardiogram. This is the most commonly used test to diagnose a ventricular septal defect. Sound waves are used to create pictures of the heart in motion. An echocardiogram can show how well blood is moving through the heart and heart valves.\n- Electrocardiogram (ECG). This quick and painless test records the electrical activity of the heart. It can show how fast or how slowly the heart is beating.\n- Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray shows the condition of the heart and lungs. It can tell if the heart is enlarged and if the lungs have extra fluid.\n- Pulse oximetry. A sensor placed on the fingertip records the amount of oxygen in the blood. Too little oxygen may be a sign of a heart or lung problem.\n- Cardiac catheterization. In this test, a thin, flexible tube (catheter) is inserted into a blood vessel at the groin or arm and guided through the blood vessels into the heart. Through cardiac catheterization, doctors can diagnose congenital heart defects and determine the function of the heart valves and chambers.\n- Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Magnetic fields and radio waves are used to create detailed images of the heart. A health care provider might request this test if more information is needed after an echocardiogram.\n- Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A series of X-rays create detailed images of the heart. It may be done if an echocardiogram didn't provide as much information as needed.\n\n# Treatment\nVentricular septal defect treatment may include regular health checkups, medications and surgery. Many babies born with a small ventricular septal defect (VSD) won't need surgery to close the hole. Some small VSDs close on their own.\nIf the VSD is small, regular health checkups may be all that's needed. Medication may be prescribed to treat any symptoms.\nBabies who have large VSDs or who tire easily during feeding may need extra nutrition to help them grow. Some babies may require medication to help treat heart failure symptoms.\nMedications won't repair a ventricular septal defect, but they may be given to treat symptoms or complications. The specific medications used depend on the symptoms and their cause. Water pills (diuretics) are used to decrease the amount of fluid in the body and reduce the strain on the heart.\nOxygen may be given.\nSurgery may be done if the VSD is medium or large or if it's causing severe symptoms. Babies who need surgery to repair the hole often have the procedure in their first year.\nA surgeon may close small ventricular septal defects if their location in the heart could cause damage to nearby structures, such as the heart valves.\nSurgeries and procedures to repair a ventricular septal defect include:\n- Open-heart surgery. This is the preferred procedure for repairing most ventricular septal defects. A surgeon uses a patch or stitches to close the hole between the lower heart chambers. This type of VSD surgery requires a heart-lung machine and an incision in the chest.\n- Catheter procedure. Some ventricular septal defects can be repaired using thin, flexible tubes (catheters) without the need for open-heart surgery. The health care provider inserts a catheter into a blood vessel, usually in the groin, and guides it to the heart. A small device is inserted through the catheter to close the hole.\nAfter ventricular septal defect surgery, regular checkups are needed for life, ideally by a heart doctor (cardiologist). Checkups often include imaging tests to determine how well surgery is working.\n\n# Self care\nLifestyle changes may be recommended to keep the heart healthy and prevent complications.\n- Prevent heart infections. Sometimes heart problems can increase the risk of infection in the lining of the heart or heart valves (endocarditis). Antibiotics may be recommended before dental procedures if you have low oxygen due to a large VSD. The medicines may also be recommended if you have a surgically repaired VSD with a patch that still has some blood flow across it. Antibiotics may also be recommended if you recently had catheter-based VSD repair. For most people with a ventricular septal defect, good oral hygiene and regular dental checkups can prevent endocarditis.\nPrevent heart infections.

Antibiotics may also be recommended if you recently had catheter-based VSD repair.\nFor most people with a ventricular septal defect, good oral hygiene and regular dental checkups can prevent endocarditis.\n- Ask about exercise restrictions. Many people with a ventricular septal defect can lead healthy, active lives without restrictions. But some may need to limit exercise and sports activities. Ask your health care provider which sports and types of exercise are safe for you or your child. People with Eisenmenger syndrome should avoid strenuous physical activity.\n- Talk to your provider before getting pregnant. If you have a ventricular septal defect and are pregnant or hoping to be, talk to your health care provider about the possible risks and complications. Together you can discuss and plan for any special care needed during pregnancy. A small VSD or a repaired one without complications doesn't pose a large additional pregnancy risk. However, a large, unrepaired VSD, irregular heart rhythms, heart failure or pulmonary hypertension increase the risk for pregnancy complications. Pregnancy is considered very high risk for those with Eisenmenger syndrome and is not recommended.\nTalk to your provider before getting pregnant.

Support groups offer parents, families and caregivers a place to share concerns and find encouragement. Ask your health care provider if there are any support groups in your area.\n\n# Preparing for your appointment\nIf a baby has a large ventricular septal defect, it will likely be diagnosed soon after birth. Sometimes it's diagnosed before birth during a pregnancy ultrasound.\nIf you think your child has a VSD that wasn't recognized at birth, make an appointment with your child's health care provider. You may be referred to a heart doctor (cardiologist).\nHere's some information to help you prepare for your appointment.\nWrite down the following and bring the notes with you to the appointment:\n- Any symptoms, including any that may seem unrelated to heart problems.\n- When the symptoms started and how often they occur.\n- Important medical information, including a family history of heart problems present at birth.\n- All medications, including those bought without a prescription. Include dosages.\n- Questions to ask the health care provider.\nAsk a family member or friend to come with you to the appointment, if possible. Someone who goes with you can help remember what the care provider says.\nPreparing a list of questions can help you and your health care provider make the most of your time together. Questions to ask the provider at the first appointment include:\n- What is likely causing these symptoms?\n- Are there other possible causes?\n- What tests are needed? Is any special preparation needed?\n- Should a specialist be consulted?\n- Are there any brochures or other printed material I can take home with me? What websites do you recommend?\nQuestions to ask if you are referred to a heart doctor (cardiologist) include:\n- How large is the hole in the heart?\n- What is the risk of complications from this condition?\n- How can we monitor for complications?\n- What treatment do you recommend?\n- How often should we schedule follow-up exams and tests?\n- What is the long-term outlook for this condition?\n- Are there any activity restrictions?\nDon't hesitate to ask other questions.\nYour health care provider is likely to ask many questions, including:\nIf you are the person affected:\n- What are the symptoms?\n- When did the symptoms begin?\n- Have the symptoms gotten worse over time?\n- Are you aware of heart problems in your family?\n- Are you being treated, or have you recently been treated, for other health conditions?\n- Are you planning to become pregnant?\nIf your baby or child is affected:\n- Does your child tire easily while eating or playing?\n- Is your child gaining weight?\n- Does your child breathe rapidly or run out of breath when eating or crying?\n- Has your child been diagnosed with other medical conditions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'Condition': 'Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)', 'Symptoms list': ['Poor eating', 'Slow or no physical growth (failure to thrive)', 'Fast breathing or breathlessness', 'Easy tiring', 'Whooshing sound when listening to the heart with a stethoscope (heart murmur)', 'Shortness of breath, especially when exercising'], 'Contextual info': {'Factors affecting diagnostic': ['Size of the hole', 'Presence of other heart problems', 'Premature birth', 'Down syndrome and other genetic conditions', 'Family history of congenital heart defects']}, 'Additional test to decide between diagnosis': 'Echocardiogram, Electrocardiogram (ECG), Chest X-ray, Pulse oximetry, Cardiac catheterization, Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, Computerized tomography (CT) scan', 'Related diagnosis': ['Atrial septal defect', 'Coarctation of the aorta', 'Double outlet syndrome', 'Patent ductus arteriosus', 'Tetralogy of Fallot', 'Heart failure', 'Eisenmenger syndrome', 'Endocarditis', 'Heart valve disease', 'Arrhythmias']}"}]}
