Despite this, she maintains a fairly active lifestyle replete with regular walks in her neighborhood.\n\nUpon retrospective analysis of her medical history, we discovered that she had undergone certain surgical modifications to her anatomy in the past, consequently increasing the complexity of diagnostics. Initial examinations have led us to have a strong belief in the possible presence of small-intestinal angiectasias.\n\nUp till now, we have attempted to manage her condition with iron supplements to tackle the deficiency and by monitoring the bleeding, but it appears that we might need to devise a more comprehensive targeted treatment plan.

While he regularly uses an over-the-counter analgesic to manage the pain, temporary relief is earned at the expense of recurring episodes of gastric discomfort. It was previously suggested to try treatment with reserpine; however, due to his pre-existing renal condition, this was deemed unsuitable for his case. \n\nThe patient's lifestyle is fairly sedentary, due to his retirement from a desk job a couple of years back.

His health records show that, in the past, he was reliant on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, and at one point, mild opioids. His dissatisfaction and minor tolerance to these previous treatments hint at a higher chance of needing increased dosages for pain relief.\n\nMedical history also reveals a prior diagnosis of liver disease, thus raising concerns on liver function tests. Additionally, an evaluation of renal function is pertinent given the patient's age, along with his progressive hypertension managed with antihypertensives. It is also worth noting that the patient has shown evidence of a slower drug metabolism rate due to a decreased activity of the CYP 450 2D6 enzyme, requiring careful consideration in analgesic management.
