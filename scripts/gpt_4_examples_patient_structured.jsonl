The chronicity, associated pain, occupational sun exposure, and the presence of palpable lymph nodes necessitate a timely and comprehensive evaluation to assess the extent of tissue involvement and determine the appropriate management plan.\\n Fill the following structure accordingly : \\n {'symptoms': [{'name of the symptom': '', 'intensity of symptom': '', 'specific attributes of the symptom': {'location': '', 'Quality of': '', 'temporalisation': ''}, 'When did the symptom appear': '', 'previous treatments': '', 'reaction to previous treaments': '', 'behaviour affecting the symptom': ''}], 'socio economic context': {}, 'geographic_context': {'location': '', 'recent travels': '', 'level of care': ''}, 'physiological context': {}, 'psychological context': {}, 'personal medical_history': {}, 'family medical_history': {}, 'current medication': {}, 'lifestyle factors': {}, 'results of recent medical tests': {}}.
