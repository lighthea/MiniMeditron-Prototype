For second-generation HR-pQCT analysis, an elastic modulus of 10,000 MPa with axial boundary conditions and a yield criterion of 1.0% critical strain and 5% critical volume is recommended.\\nTable 4 Summary of elastic modulus, boundary conditions, and common yield criterion for first- and second-generation HR-pQCT. All models applied a 1% compressive strain in the axial direction and used a Poisson\\\\u2019s ratio of 0.3.

Nomenclature proposed in Tables 2, 3, and 5 should be used, and use of direct or indirect measurement techniques should be clearly indicated. The minimum parameters to describe trabecular bone morphology should include trabecular bone volume fraction, and trabecular number, thickness, and separation; for cortical bone morphology, cortical thickness, and cortical porosity should be reported.\\n\\n# Table 2 definition, units, andmeasurement ofmethods of common whole bone and cortical microarchitecture parameters obtained from available hrpqct\\n\\n# Systems. italicized parameters are the minimum set to be reported when describing cortical bone morphology.\\nd Superscript should be used if reporting results using the derived measurement method.\\n- Description of direct 3D morphological method of measurement\\n\\\\u2020 Description of derived (indirect) morphological method of measurement\\n\\\\u2021 StrAx is a derived method with analysis bone compartments defined differently than the extended cortical analysis and is not integrated into the Scanco workflow\\nIdeally the minimum set of parameters reported are bolded.\\n\\n# Table 3 definition, units, and measurement of methods of common trabecular microarchitecture parameters obtained from available hr-pqct\\n\\n# Systems. italicized parameters are the minimum set to be reported when describing trabecular bone morphology.\\nd Superscript should be used if reporting results using the derived measurement method.\\n- Description of direct 3D morphological method of measurement\\n\\\\u2020 Description of derived (indirect) morphological method of measurement\\nIdeally the minimum set of parameters reported are bolded.\\n\\n# Table 5 definition, units, and measurement of methods of common micro-finite element analysis outcomes obtained from available hr-pqct systems\\n- These properties are scalar values defined for each element. Properties can be visualized on the model to inspect localized stress and strains, or expressed in terms of histograms. The average or median value across the model can be reported, and the histogram skewness or kurtosis can be used to provide insight into the strain distributions in the context of bone adaptation.\\nPrecision error should be measured and reported for each research center, specific to study protocol. Cross-sectional studies should report precision with unregistered scans, and longitudinal studies should report precision with the registration technique used in the study design.\\n\\n# Quality control and training\\nQuality control should follow manufacturer maintenance protocol, including daily and weekly scanning of QC phantoms. Scanner drift should be actively monitored, and the use of Shewhart charts to track scanner stability is recommended.\\nNew operators should be trained by an experienced operator and available training tools used. New operators should be trained in patient management and positioning, anatomical measurements, location of the reference line, and manual correction of contours generated by the automated and semi-automated protocols. Training should be supplemented with online reference line training developed by UCSF , and other online resources, as they become available.\\nContinuity across scanner generations (makes, models) should be assessed through cross-calibration. It is important to understand relationships between parameters measured on different scanner generations . Typically, density-based parameters can be converted between scanner generations, but resolution-dependent parameters (e.g., Tb.Th) are problematic and should not be compared between generations.\\nMulti-center studies should report inter-scanner precision error, and it is recommended that these are estimated using a calibration phantom that replicates geometry, densities, and microarchitecture of standard scan sites.\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"{'Condition': 'Assessment of Bone Density and Microarchitecture In Vivo Using High-Resolution Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography', 'Symptoms list': [], 'Contextual info': {'Factors affecting diagnostic': ['Method of selecting scan site', 'Image processing and corrections required', 'Standardized constitutive properties and boundary conditions', '3D or 2D registration for longitudinal studies', 'Scanner maintenance protocols', 'Training for operators', 'Cross-calibration across scanner generations', 'Inter-scanner precision error for multi-center studies']}, 'Additional test to decide between diagnosis': '', 'Related diagnosis': []}\"}]}, {'messages': [{'role': 'user', 'content': \"Fill the following structure accordingly.

There is no evidence of efficacy in the majority of patients. There are also concerns about the potential risks of the procedure.\\nIt is recommended that this procedure should not be used. The Institute's information for the public complements this guidance in explaining the concerns about the procedure.# The procedure\\n\\n# Indications\\nPresbyopia is an age-related and progressive loss of focusing power of the lens in the eye. It leads to a gradual decline in the ability to focus on close objects.\\nStandard treatment for presbyopia is the use of corrective spectacles. As the condition worsens, prescriptions need to be changed accordingly.\\n\\n# Outline of the procedure\\nScleral expansion surgery involves making small incisions in the eye and inserting bands to stretch the part of the sclera that lies beneath the ciliary muscles that control accommodation. This procedure is claimed to improve accommodation.\\n\\n# Efficacy\\nAll studies identified were of poor quality. The evidence was limited to one non-randomised controlled study of 29 patients, two very small case series (of six and three patients, respectively) and two case reports. In the controlled study, in which the dominant eye was operated on and the other eye served as a control, improvement in median reading acuity score at 20 cm was reported as –0.41 for operated eyes and –0.35 for control eyes (p < 0.03), indicating that the improvement in operated eyes was greater. No significant difference in reading acuity was found at 30 cm or 40 cm. One case series reported that near visual acuity improved temporarily in 3/8 eyes (38%), but it was no better than before surgery at day 360. In the same study, implanted bands were removed from three eyes upon patient request because of lack of benefit. In another case series of three patients, scleral expansion surgery failed to restore accommodation in any patients. For more details, refer to the Sources of evidence section.\\nThe Specialist Advisors considered the evidence to suggest that the procedure is not efficacious. One Advisor noted that the procedure was controversial because it was based on a novel theory of the mechanism of accommodation of the human eye that was in direct opposition to other generally accepted theories.\\n\\n# Safety\\nThe complications reported in the identified studies were: two case reports of band removal because of band migration or chronic pain and swelling; two cases of perforated conjunctiva in a study of 8 patients; and one report of transient elevation of intraocular pressure in a study of 29 patients. For more details, refer to the Sources of evidence section.\\nThe Specialist Advisors listed the main potential adverse events as intraocular haemorrhage, retinal detachment, endophthalmitis, glaucoma, conjunctival scarring and scleral thinning.\\nAndrew DillonChief ExecutiveJuly 2004# Further information\\n\\n# Sources of evidence\\nThe evidence considered by the Interventional Procedures Advisory Committee is described in the following document.\\n'Interventional procedure overview of sclera expansion surgery for presbyopia', April 2003.\\n\\n# Information for the public\\nNICE has produced information on this procedure for patients and carers ('Understanding NICE guidance'). It explains the nature of the procedure and the guidance issued by NICE, and has been written with patient consent in mind.# About this guidance\\nNICE interventional procedure guidance makes recommendations on the safety and efficacy of the procedure. It does not cover whether or not the NHS should fund a procedure. Funding decisions are taken by local NHS bodies after considering the clinical effectiveness of the procedure and whether it represents value for money for the NHS. It is for healthcare professionals and people using the NHS in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and is endorsed by Healthcare Improvement Scotland for implementation by NHSScotland.\\nThis guidance was developed using the NICE interventional procedure guidance process.\\nWe have produced a summary of this guidance for patients and carers. Information about the evidence it is based on is also available.\\nChanges since publication\\nJanuary 2012: minor maintenance.\\nYour responsibility\\nThis guidance represents the views of NICE and was arrived at after careful consideration of the available evidence. Healthcare professionals are expected to take it fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement. This guidance does not, however, override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make appropriate decisions in the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with the patient and/or guardian or carer.\\nImplementation of this guidance is the responsibility of local commissioners and/or providers. Commissioners and providers are reminded that it is their responsibility to implement the guidance, in their local context, in light of their duties to avoid unlawful discrimination and to have regard to promoting equality of opportunity. Nothing in this guidance should be interpreted in a way which would be inconsistent with compliance with those duties.\\nCopyright\\n© National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence 2004.

The duct walls may thicken, and the duct may fill with fluid. The milk duct may become blocked or clogged with a thick, sticky substance. The condition often causes no symptoms, but some women may have nipple discharge, breast tenderness or inflammation of the clogged duct (periductal mastitis).\\nMammary duct ectasia most often occurs in women during perimenopause — around age 45 to 55 years — but it can happen after menopause, too. The condition often improves without treatment. If symptoms persist, you may need antibiotics or possibly surgery to remove the affected milk duct.\\nThough it's normal to worry about any changes in your breasts, mammary duct ectasia and periductal mastitis aren't risk factors for breast cancer.\\nMammary duct ectasia occurs when one or more milk ducts beneath the nipple becomes wider (dilated). The duct may also fill with fluid and become blocked or clogged with a thick, sticky substance. Mammary duct ectasia usually causes no signs or symptoms, but some women may have nipple discharge, breast tenderness or inflammation of the clogged duct.\\n\\n# Symptoms\\nMammary duct ectasia often doesn't cause any signs or symptoms, but some people experience:\\n- A dirty white, greenish or black nipple discharge from one or both nipples\\n- Tenderness in the nipple or surrounding breast tissue (areola)\\n- Redness of the nipple and areolar tissue\\n- A breast lump or thickening near the clogged duct\\n- A nipple that's turned inward (inverted)\\nA bacterial infection called mastitis also may develop in the affected milk duct, causing breast tenderness, inflammation in the area around the nipple (areola) and fever.\\nSigns and symptoms of mammary duct ectasia may improve on their own.\\nA nipple that's always been turned inward (inverted) usually isn't a medical concern. But a nipple that has recently turned inward should be checked by a doctor.\\n\\n# When to see a doctor\\nMake an appointment with your doctor if you notice changes in your breasts — such as a new breast lump, spontaneous nipple discharge, skin redness or inflammation, or an inverted nipple — that are persistent or that worry you.\\n\\n# Causes\\nYour breasts are made up of connective tissues that include a system of tiny passages that carry milk to the nipples (milk ducts). Mammary duct ectasia occurs when a milk duct beneath the nipple widens. The duct walls may thicken and fill with fluid, becoming blocked or clogged with a sticky substance. Inflammation may result.\\nExperts don't know exactly what causes mammary duct ectasia. Some speculate the cause to be associated with:\\n- Breast tissue changes due to aging. As you age, the composition of your breast tissue changes from mostly glandular to mostly fatty in a process called involution. These normal breast changes can sometimes lead to a blocked milk duct and the inflammation associated with mammary duct ectasia.\\n- Smoking. Cigarette smoking may be associated with widening of milk ducts, which can lead to inflammation and, possibly, mammary duct ectasia.\\n- Nipple inversion. A newly inverted nipple may obstruct milk ducts, causing inflammation and infection. A nipple that's newly inverted could also be a sign of a more serious underlying condition, such as cancer.\\n\\n# Complications\\nComplications of mammary duct ectasia are usually minor and often more bothersome than serious. These may include:\\n- Nipple discharge. Nipple discharge caused by mammary duct ectasia can be frustrating. Fluid leaking from your nipples can cause embarrassing wetness and staining on your clothes.\\n- Breast discomfort. Mammary duct ectasia can cause redness, swelling and tenderness around your nipples.\\n- Infection. An inflammatory infection (periductal mastitis) may develop in the affected milk duct, sometimes causing pain in or around the nipple, a general feeling of illness or a fever. Persistent redness and worsening pain could be a sign of a bacterial infection and can lead to an abscess — a collection of pus in your breast tissue — which may require a procedure to drain it.\\n- Concern about breast cancer. When you notice a change in your breast, you may worry that it's a sign of breast cancer, especially if you develop a hard lump around the nipple or areola. Having a history of mammary duct ectasia doesn't increase your risk of breast cancer. Still, it's important to see your doctor promptly anytime you notice breast changes.# Diagnosis & treatment\\n\\n# Diagnosis\\nBased on information you provide to your doctor and the results of a physical exam, you might need additional tests, including:\\n- Diagnostic ultrasound of the nipple and areola. An ultrasound uses sound waves to make images of breast tissue. It allows your doctor to evaluate the milk ducts beneath your nipple. A diagnostic ultrasound lets your doctor focus on an area of suspicion.\\n- Diagnostic mammography. Mammography provides X-ray images of your breast and can help your doctor evaluate your breast tissue. A diagnostic mammogram provides more-detailed views of a specific area of your breast than a screening mammogram does.\\n\\n# Treatment\\nMammary duct ectasia doesn't always require treatment. If your symptoms are bothersome, however, treatment options may include:\\n- Antibiotics. Your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic for 10 to 14 days to treat an infection caused by mammary duct ectasia. Even if your symptoms greatly improve or disappear completely after starting the antibiotic, it's important to take all your medication as prescribed.\\n- Pain medication. You could try a mild pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), as needed for breast discomfort. Follow your doctor's recommendation on which pain reliever is best for you.\\n- Surgery. If an abscess has developed and antibiotics and self-care don't work, the affected milk duct may be surgically removed. This procedure is done through a tiny incision at the edge of the colored tissue around your nipple (areola). Surgery rarely is needed for mammary duct ectasia.\\n\\n# Self care\\nTo relieve discomfort associated with mammary duct ectasia, you might try these self-care measures:\\n- Apply warm compresses. A warm compress applied to your nipple and surrounding area may soothe painful breast tissue.\\n- Use breast pads for nipple discharge. Using breast pads or nursing pads can keep fluid from leaking through your clothing. These pads are available at drugstores and many retail stores that sell baby care products.\\n- Wear a support bra. Choose bras with good support to minimize breast discomfort. A well-fitting bra can also help keep a breast pad in place to absorb nipple discharge.\\n- Sleep on the opposite side. Avoid sleeping on the same side of your body as your affected breast to help prevent swelling and further discomfort.\\n- Stop smoking. Smoking may make it harder to treat an infection, and ongoing smoking may result in recurrent infections or an abscess.\\n\\n# Preparing for your appointment\\nFor evaluation of a new breast lump or changes in your breast, you're likely to start by seeing your primary care doctor. In some cases, based on a clinical breast exam or findings on the mammogram or ultrasound, you may be referred to a breast health specialist.\\nThe initial evaluation focuses on your medical history and the signs and symptoms you're experiencing, including how they're related to your menstrual cycle. To prepare for this discussion with your doctor:\\n- Take note of all your symptoms, even if they seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment.\\n- Review key personal information, including major stresses or recent life changes.\\n- Make a list of all medications, vitamins and supplements that you regularly take.\\n- Write down questions to ask your doctor, to make sure you remember everything you want to ask.\\nFor mammary duct ectasia, here are some questions you might ask your doctor:\\n- What's causing my symptoms?\\n- Will this condition resolve itself, or will I need treatment?\\n- What treatment approach do you recommend?\\n- Is there an over-the-counter medication I can take for pain relief?\\n- What self-care measures can I try?\\n- Do you have printed information I can take home with me? What websites do you recommend?\\nYour doctor may ask you a number of questions, such as:\\n- How long have you experienced symptoms?\\n- Have your symptoms changed over time?\\n- Do you experience breast pain? How severe?\\n- Do you have nipple discharge? How would you describe the color, consistency and amount?\\n- Do your symptoms occur in one or both breasts?\\n- Have you had a fever?\\n- When was your last mammogram?\\n- Have you ever been diagnosed with a precancerous breast condition?\\n- Have you ever had a breast biopsy or been diagnosed with a benign breast condition?\\n- Has your mother, a sister or anyone else in your family had breast cancer?\\n- What, if anything, seems to improve your symptoms?\\n- What, if anything, appears to worsen your symptoms?\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"{'Condition': 'Mammary duct ectasia', 'Symptoms list': ['Dirty white, greenish or black nipple discharge', 'Tenderness in the nipple or surrounding breast tissue (areola)', 'Redness of the nipple and areolar tissue', 'Breast lump or thickening near the clogged duct', 'Turned inward (inverted) nipple', 'Breast tenderness', 'Inflammation in the area around the nipple (areola)', 'Fever'], 'Contextual info': {'Factors affecting diagnostic': ['Age', 'Nipple inversion', 'Smoking']}, 'Additional test to decide between diagnosis': 'Diagnostic ultrasound of the nipple and areola, Diagnostic mammography', 'Related diagnosis': ['Periductal mastitis', 'Inverted Nipple', 'Breast cancer']}\"}]}, {'messages': [{'role': 'user', 'content': \"Fill the following structure accordingly.

This involves inserting an artificial iris into the eye.\\n\\n# Recommendations\\nEvidence on the safety and efficacy of artificial iris implant insertion for acquired aniridia is limited in quantity and quality. Therefore, this procedure should only be used with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent, and audit or research. Find out what special arrangements mean on the NICE website.\\nClinicians wishing to do artificial iris implant insertion for acquired aniridia should:\\nInform the clinical governance leads in their NHS trusts.\\nGive patients clear information to support shared decision making, including NICE's information for the public.\\nEnsure that patients understand the procedure's safety and efficacy, as well as any uncertainties about these.\\nAudit and review clinical outcomes of all patients having the procedure. NICE has identified relevant audit criteria and developed an audit tool (which is for use at local discretion).\\nThe procedure should only be done by ophthalmic surgeons with appropriate experience and training.\\nResearch could include the use of observational data from cohort studies or high-quality case series. Studies should report details of patient selection and the type of implant used. Outcomes should include quality of life and other patient-reported outcomes.\\nNICE may update the guidance on publication of further evidence.# The condition, current treatments and procedure\\n\\n# The condition\\nAcquired aniridia means the iris is either missing or incomplete as a result of trauma, surgery or laser treatment.\\nPeople with aniridia may be very light sensitive (photophobic) and report symptoms of glare. They may develop other eye problems such as glaucoma, cataract and corneal opacification. The degree of vision loss varies.\\n\\n# Current treatments\\nTreatment includes contact lenses with iris prints and tinted spectacle lenses.\\nSurgical implantation of an artificial iris device may be an option for some people with complete or partial acquired aniridia.\\n\\n# The procedure\\nThere are different devices available, including a solid acrylic ring or segment and a flexible silicone disc, which can be custom-made for each patient. The implant has a defined pupil size, which offers a compromise between day and night vision.\\nThe artificial iris implant is inserted using local or general anaesthesia. The exact details of the procedure vary according to the type of implant being used.\\nFlexible implants are rolled up and inserted through a cut about 3\\xa0mm long at the edge of the cornea, into the posterior chamber of the eye. They are then unfolded and fixed in the eye. If sutures are needed to hold the implant in place, a larger cut may be necessary. The implant insertion can be done on its own or at the time of cataract or lens fixation surgery.\\nSolid ring implants are typically inserted during cataract surgery along with an intraocular lens. In some patients, an iris reconstruction lens containing both an artificial iris and a lens is implanted. Depending on the condition of the eye, the lens and iris device may need to be sutured to the sclera.\\nThe aim of artificial iris implant insertion is to improve visual acuity, reduce photophobia and glare, and improve the eye's appearance.\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"{'Condition': 'Acquired aniridia', 'Symptoms list': ['Light sensitivity (photophobia)', 'Glare', 'Vision loss', 'Glaucoma', 'Cataract', 'Corneal opacification'], 'Contextual info': {'Factors affecting diagnostic': ['Trauma', 'Surgery', 'Laser treatment']}, 'Additional test to decide between diagnosis': '', 'Related diagnosis': ['Glaucoma', 'Cataract', 'Corneal opacification']}\"}]}, {'messages': [{'role': 'user', 'content': \"Fill the following structure accordingly.

In addition, use of the Institute's information for the public is recommended.\\nFurther publication of longer-term efficacy outcomes will be useful. Clinicians should submit data to the British Association of Urological Surgeons registry, or the British Society of Urogynaecologists registry (for further information contact the British Society of Urogynaecologists).# The procedure\\n\\n# Indications\\nStress urinary incontinence is the involuntary leakage of urine during exercise or movements such as coughing, sneezing and laughing. It is usually caused by weak or damaged muscles and connective tissues of the pelvic floor, or by weakness of the urethral sphincter itself. It is estimated that 10–52% of adult women have some form of incontinence.\\nTypically, first-line treatment is conservative and includes pelvic floor muscle training, electrical stimulation and biofeedback. If the condition does not improve, surgical alternatives in women may include colposuspension, tension-free vaginal tape, transobturator foramen procedures or traditional suburethral slings.\\n\\n# Outline of the procedure\\nIntramural urethral bulking aims to augment the urethral wall and increase the urethral closure force. Several millilitres of bulking agent are injected into the submucosa of the proximal urethra just distal to the bladder neck. The injections are usually administered under local anaesthesia, either transurethrally or para-urethrally. Injections are undertaken either under vision using a cytoscope; or blindly, using a non-endoscopic implantation device.\\nA number of bulking agents are currently available.\\n\\n# Efficacy\\nA small randomised controlled trial reported that 53% (34/64) of patients treated by urethral bulking with collagen had no incontinence at 12 months, compared with 72% (39/54) treated with conventional open surgery.\\nOne case series of patients treated with collagen reported that, after 12 months, 42% (38/90) had either no incontinence or an improvement in symptoms, as measured objectively using cystometry and abdominal leak point pressure. One case series of patients treated with silicone particles reported that 68% (69/102) had either no incontinence or marked improvement after a mean follow-up of 3 months. This proportion decreased to 48% (40/84) after a mean follow-up of 18 months. Four randomised controlled trials reported no difference in efficacy between different bulking agents. For more details, refer to the Sources of evidence.\\nThe Specialist Advisors noted that efficacy may depend on patient selection, the bulking agent used and the injection technique.\\n\\n# Safety\\nFive case series reported safety data on a total of 389 patients. The most commonly reported adverse events were urinary tract infection, affecting 1% (1/102) to 12% (11/90) of patients, and urinary retention, affecting 0% (0/40) to 11% (10/90) of patients. Other reported complications included abscess at the injection site, urgency of micturition and prolonged pain. For more details, refer to the Sources of evidence.\\nThe Specialist Advisors stated that migration of the bulking agent, voiding difficulties, urinary tract infection and allergic reaction are potential adverse events. Haemorrhage was listed as a rare potential adverse event.\\n\\n# Other comments\\nThe Committee noted that a variety of bulking agents may be used for these procedures which may have different risk and benefit profiles.\\nThe Committee particularly noted that the benefits of these procedures diminish with time but that the procedure can be repeated.# Further information\\nNICE has issued guidance on tension-free vaginal tape (replaced by NICE clinical guideline 40, 'Urinary incontinence: the management of urinary incontinence in women'), transobturator foramen procedures for stress urinary incontinence and insertion of extra-urethral (non-circumferential) retropubic adjustable compression devices.

It's a common heart problem present at birth (congenital heart defect). The hole occurs in the wall that separates the heart's lower chambers (ventricles).\\nA ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a hole in the heart that's present at birth (congenital heart defect). The hole is between the lower heart chambers (right and left ventricles). It allows oxygen-rich blood to move back into the lungs instead of being pumped to the rest of the body.\\nA ventricular septal defect (VSD) changes how blood flows through the heart and lungs. Oxygen-rich blood gets pumped back to the lungs instead of out to the body. The oxygen-rich blood mixes with oxygen-poor blood. These changes may increase blood pressure in the lungs and require the heart to work harder to pump blood.\\nA small ventricular septal defect may cause no problems. Many small ventricular septal defects (VSDs) close on their own. Babies with medium or larger VSDs may need surgery early in life to prevent complications.\\n\\n# Symptoms\\nSymptoms of serious heart problems present at birth (congenital heart defects) often appear during the first few days, weeks or months of a child's life.\\nSymptoms of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) depend on the size of the hole and if there are any other heart problems. A small VSD may never cause symptoms.\\nIn general, VSD symptoms in a baby may include:\\n- Poor eating\\n- Slow or no physical growth (failure to thrive)\\n- Fast breathing or breathlessness\\n- Easy tiring\\n- Whooshing sound when listening to the heart with a stethoscope (heart murmur)\\nSymptoms of a ventricular septal defect in adults may include:\\n- Shortness of breath, especially when exercising\\n- Whooshing sound when listening to the heart with a stethoscope (heart murmur)\\n\\n# When to see a doctor\\nCall your health care provider if your baby:\\n- Tires easily when eating or playing\\n- Is not gaining weight\\n- Becomes breathless when eating or crying\\n- Breathes rapidly or is short of breath\\nCall your provider if these symptoms develop:\\n- Shortness of breath\\n- Rapid or irregular heartbeat\\n- Fatigue or weakness\\n\\n# Causes\\nVentricular septal defect (VSD) occurs as the baby's heart is developing during pregnancy. The muscular wall separating the heart into left and right sides doesn't form fully, leaving one or more holes. The size of the hole or holes can vary.\\nThere's often no clear cause. Genetics and environmental factors may play a role. VSDs can occur alone or with other heart problems present at birth. Rarely, a ventricular septal defect can occur later in life after a heart attack or certain heart procedures.\\nTo understand more about ventricular septal defect (VSD), it may be helpful to know how the heart typically works.\\nA typical heart has two upper and two lower chambers. The upper chambers, the right and left atria, receive incoming blood. The lower chambers, the more muscular right and left ventricles, pump blood out of the heart. The heart valves, which keep blood flowing in the right direction, are gates at the chamber openings.\\nThe typical heart is made of four chambers — two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles).\\n- The right side of the heart moves blood to the lungs.\\n- In the lungs, blood picks up oxygen.\\n- The lungs pump the oxygen-rich blood to the heart's left side.\\n- The left side of the heart pumps the oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body.\\nA ventricular septal defect changes the direction of blood flow in the heart and lungs. The hole lets oxygen-rich blood go back into the lungs, instead of going out to the body. Oxygen-rich blood and oxygen-poor blood now mix together. If the ventricular septal defect is large, the blood pressure in the lung arteries may increase. The heart then must work harder to pump blood. A large VSD can also increase the amount of blood flow in the lung arteries, causing congestion.\\n\\n# Risk factors\\nRisk factors for ventricular septal defect include:\\n- Premature birth\\n- Down syndrome and other genetic conditions\\n- Family history of heart problems present at birth (congenital heart defects)\\nA baby born with ventricular septal defect may have other heart problems, such as:\\n- Atrial septal defect\\n- Coarctation of the aorta\\n- Double outlet syndrome\\n- Patent ductus arteriosus\\n- Tetralogy of Fallot\\nIf you already have a child with a congenital heart defect, a genetic counselor can discuss the risk of your next child having one.\\n\\n# Complications\\nA small ventricular septal defect (VSD) may never cause any problems. Some medium or large VSDs may be life-threatening. Treatment can help prevent many complications.\\nComplications of ventricular septal defect can include:\\n- Heart failure. In a heart with a medium or large VSD, the heart works harder and the lungs have too much blood pumped to them. Without treatment, heart failure can develop.\\n- Eisenmenger syndrome. An unrepaired hole in the heart can lead to this complication after many years. Irregular blood flow causes the blood vessels in the lungs to become stiff and narrow. Blood pressure rises in the lungs' arteries (pulmonary hypertension). This syndrome permanently damages the blood vessels in the lungs.\\n- Endocarditis. This is a rare complication of VSD. An infection causes life-threatening inflammation of the inner lining of the heart's chambers and valves.\\n- Other heart problems. These include heart valve disease and irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias).\\n\\n# Prevention\\nBecause the cause is unclear, it may not be possible to prevent ventricular septal defect (VSD). But getting good prenatal care is important. If you have a VSD and are planning to become pregnant, schedule a visit with your health care provider and follow these steps:\\n- Get early prenatal care, even before you're pregnant. Talk to your provider before you get pregnant about your health and discuss any lifestyle changes that your doctor may recommend for a healthy pregnancy. Also, be sure you talk to your doctor about any medications you're taking.\\n- Take a multivitamin with folic acid. Taking 400 micrograms of folic acid daily has been shown to reduce birth defects in the brain and spinal cord. It may help reduce the risk of heart defects as well.\\n- Avoid alcohol. Drinking alcohol during pregnancy increases the risk of congenital heart defects.\\n- Don't smoke or use illegal drugs. If you smoke, quit. Smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of a congenital heart defect in the baby. Avoid using illegal drugs as they may harm a developing baby.\\n- Get recommended vaccinations. Be sure you're up to date on all of your vaccinations before becoming pregnant. Some infections can be harmful to a developing fetus. For example, having rubella (German measles) during pregnancy can cause problems in a baby's heart development. A blood test done before pregnancy can determine if you're immune to rubella. A vaccine is available for those who aren't immune.\\n- Keep diabetes under control. Careful control of blood sugar before and during pregnancy can reduce the risk of congenital heart defects in the baby. Diabetes that develops during pregnancy (gestational diabetes) generally doesn't increase a baby's risk. If you have diabetes, work with your provider to be sure it's well controlled before getting pregnant.\\n- Check with your provider before taking any medications. Some medications can cause birth defects. Tell your provider about all the medications you take, including those bought without a prescription.\\nIf you have a family history of heart problems present at birth, consider talking with a genetic counselor and a heart doctor (cardiologist) before getting pregnant.# Diagnosis & treatment\\n\\n# Diagnosis\\nSome ventricular septal defects (VSDs) are diagnosed soon after a child is born. However, ventricular septal defects (VSDs) may not be diagnosed until later in life. Sometimes a ventricular septal defect (VSD) can be detected by a pregnancy ultrasound before the baby is born.\\nIf ventricular septal defect is present, the health care provider may hear a whooshing sound (heart murmur) when listening to the heart with a stethoscope.\\nTests that are done to help diagnose ventricular septal defect include:\\n- Echocardiogram. This is the most commonly used test to diagnose a ventricular septal defect. Sound waves are used to create pictures of the heart in motion. An echocardiogram can show how well blood is moving through the heart and heart valves.\\n- Electrocardiogram (ECG). This quick and painless test records the electrical activity of the heart. It can show how fast or how slowly the heart is beating.\\n- Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray shows the condition of the heart and lungs. It can tell if the heart is enlarged and if the lungs have extra fluid.\\n- Pulse oximetry. A sensor placed on the fingertip records the amount of oxygen in the blood. Too little oxygen may be a sign of a heart or lung problem.\\n- Cardiac catheterization. In this test, a thin, flexible tube (catheter) is inserted into a blood vessel at the groin or arm and guided through the blood vessels into the heart. Through cardiac catheterization, doctors can diagnose congenital heart defects and determine the function of the heart valves and chambers.\\n- Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Magnetic fields and radio waves are used to create detailed images of the heart. A health care provider might request this test if more information is needed after an echocardiogram.\\n- Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A series of X-rays create detailed images of the heart. It may be done if an echocardiogram didn't provide as much information as needed.\\n\\n# Treatment\\nVentricular septal defect treatment may include regular health checkups, medications and surgery. Many babies born with a small ventricular septal defect (VSD) won't need surgery to close the hole. Some small VSDs close on their own.\\nIf the VSD is small, regular health checkups may be all that's needed. Medication may be prescribed to treat any symptoms.\\nBabies who have large VSDs or who tire easily during feeding may need extra nutrition to help them grow. Some babies may require medication to help treat heart failure symptoms.\\nMedications won't repair a ventricular septal defect, but they may be given to treat symptoms or complications. The specific medications used depend on the symptoms and their cause. Water pills (diuretics) are used to decrease the amount of fluid in the body and reduce the strain on the heart.\\nOxygen may be given.\\nSurgery may be done if the VSD is medium or large or if it's causing severe symptoms. Babies who need surgery to repair the hole often have the procedure in their first year.\\nA surgeon may close small ventricular septal defects if their location in the heart could cause damage to nearby structures, such as the heart valves.\\nSurgeries and procedures to repair a ventricular septal defect include:\\n- Open-heart surgery. This is the preferred procedure for repairing most ventricular septal defects. A surgeon uses a patch or stitches to close the hole between the lower heart chambers. This type of VSD surgery requires a heart-lung machine and an incision in the chest.\\n- Catheter procedure. Some ventricular septal defects can be repaired using thin, flexible tubes (catheters) without the need for open-heart surgery. The health care provider inserts a catheter into a blood vessel, usually in the groin, and guides it to the heart. A small device is inserted through the catheter to close the hole.\\nAfter ventricular septal defect surgery, regular checkups are needed for life, ideally by a heart doctor (cardiologist). Checkups often include imaging tests to determine how well surgery is working.\\n\\n# Self care\\nLifestyle changes may be recommended to keep the heart healthy and prevent complications.\\n- Prevent heart infections. Sometimes heart problems can increase the risk of infection in the lining of the heart or heart valves (endocarditis). Antibiotics may be recommended before dental procedures if you have low oxygen due to a large VSD. The medicines may also be recommended if you have a surgically repaired VSD with a patch that still has some blood flow across it. Antibiotics may also be recommended if you recently had catheter-based VSD repair. For most people with a ventricular septal defect, good oral hygiene and regular dental checkups can prevent endocarditis.\\nPrevent heart infections.

Antibiotics may also be recommended if you recently had catheter-based VSD repair.\\nFor most people with a ventricular septal defect, good oral hygiene and regular dental checkups can prevent endocarditis.\\n- Ask about exercise restrictions. Many people with a ventricular septal defect can lead healthy, active lives without restrictions. But some may need to limit exercise and sports activities. Ask your health care provider which sports and types of exercise are safe for you or your child. People with Eisenmenger syndrome should avoid strenuous physical activity.\\n- Talk to your provider before getting pregnant. If you have a ventricular septal defect and are pregnant or hoping to be, talk to your health care provider about the possible risks and complications. Together you can discuss and plan for any special care needed during pregnancy. A small VSD or a repaired one without complications doesn't pose a large additional pregnancy risk. However, a large, unrepaired VSD, irregular heart rhythms, heart failure or pulmonary hypertension increase the risk for pregnancy complications. Pregnancy is considered very high risk for those with Eisenmenger syndrome and is not recommended.\\nTalk to your provider before getting pregnant.

Despite having a typically cheerful and jovial personality, he has reportedly been expressing toxic thoughts about self-harm and has admitted to contemplating suicide. Reassuringly, he has not attempted any such action thus far. \\n\\nThe patient seems to be persistently wrestling with intense feelings of despair, and states that he can no longer derive pleasure from activities he used to enjoy, such as playing sports and listening to music. He has suffered from no major physical illnesses in the past and denies substance abuse. He has tried over-the-counter sleeping aids for what he describes as chronic insomnia, but they appear to have provided minimal relief.\\n\\nAssessment of his pain levels indicates that they are more emotional and mental rather than physical. However, he does mention recurrent headaches. As for his lifestyle, he lost his job six months ago and is currently unemployed, a situation that may possibly have acted as a catalytic event, though deeper investigation is required. His family mentions no history of similar episodes or any significant mental health issues in the past. His current state, however, is causing a serious concern for his wellbeing.'}\n",
